Can't open network interface
----------------------------
If you get errors about not being able to open the network interface:

- install wireshark and try again (preferred)*
- run the script as sudo

Installing Wireshark changes the permissions of your interfaces so that it can read them. I actually recommend this for several reasons. One it's better than running scripts as sudo and two wireshark is great :)
