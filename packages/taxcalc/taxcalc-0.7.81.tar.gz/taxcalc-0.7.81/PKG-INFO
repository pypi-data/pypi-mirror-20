        Tax-Calculator
        ==============
        
        Tax-Calculator simulates the US federal individual income tax
        system.  In conjunction with micro data that represent the US
        population and a set of behavioral assumptions, Tax-Calculator can
        be used to conduct revenue scoring and distributional analyses of tax
        policies.  Tax-Calculator is written in Python, an interpreted
        language that can execute on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

        ==========
        
        Results will change as the underlying models improve. A fundamental
        reason for adopting open source methods in this project is so that
        people from all backgrounds can contribute to the models that our
        society uses to assess economic policy; when community-contributed
        improvements are incorporated, the model will produce different
        results.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        There are two common ways to get started with Tax-Calculator:
        
        The **first way** is to install the Tax-Calculator repository on your
        computer.  Do this by following the instructions in our [Contributor
        Guide](http://taxcalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor_guide.html).
        After the installation you can read the source code and either use
        Tax-Calculator as is or develop new Tax-Calculator capabilities.
        
        When using Tax-Calculator on your computer you will have to supply
        your own input data on tax filing units because the repository does
        not include a representative sample of tax filing units.  However, you
        can use it to estimate tax liabilities and marginal tax rates for any
        collection of filing units specified in [Internet-TAXSIM input
        format](http://users.nber.org/~taxsim/taxsim-calc9/) using the
        `simtax.py` command-line interface to Tax-Calculator.  And you can
        also process your own CSV-formatted data using the `inctax.py`
        command-line interface to Tax-Calculator, but when doing this be
        sure to read the [data-preparation guidelines](DATAPREP.md).
        
        When developing new Tax-Calculator capabilities be sure to read about
        our [coding style](CODING.md) and [testing procedures](TESTING.md)
        after you have read completely the [Contributor
        Guide](http://taxcalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor_guide.html).
        
        The **second way** is to access Tax-Calculator through our web
        application, [TaxBrain](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain).  This way
        allows you to generate aggregate and distributional tax reform
        estimates using a nationally representative sample of tax filing units
        that is not part of the Tax-Calculator repository.
        
        And, of course, you can get started with Tax-Calculator both ways.
