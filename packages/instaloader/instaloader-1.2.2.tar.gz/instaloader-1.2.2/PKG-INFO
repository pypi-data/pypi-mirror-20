Description: Instaloader
        ===========
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Instaloader is written in Python, thus ensure having
        `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ (at least version 3.5) installed.
        
        If you intend to use this tool under Windows, it is recommended
        to install
        `win-unicode-console <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/win_unicode_console>`__.
        
        If you have `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__ installed, you
        may install Instaloader using
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install instaloader
        
        Alternatively, to get the most current version of Instaloader from our
        `Git repository <https://github.com/Thammus/instaloader>`__:
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install git+https://github.com/Thammus/instaloader
        
        Instaloader requires
        `requests <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>`__, which
        will be installed automatically, if it is not already installed.
        
        How to automatically download pictures from Instagram
        -----------------------------------------------------
        
        To download a set of profiles, do
        
        ::
        
            instaloader profile [profile ...]
        
        where ``profile`` is the name of a profile you want to download. Instead
        of only one profile, you may also specify a list of profiles.
        
        To later update your local copy of that profile, you may run
        
        ::
        
            instaloader --fast-update profile [profile ...]
        
        When ``--fast-update`` is given, Instaloader terminates when arriving at
        the first already-downloaded picture.
        
        Instaloader can also be used to **download private profiles**. To do so,
        invoke it with
        
        ::
        
            instaloader --login=your_username profile [profile ...]
        
        When invoked like this, it also **stores the session cookies** in a file
        in ``/tmp``, which will be reused later when ``--login`` is given. So
        you can download private profiles **non-interactively** when you already
        have a valid session cookie file.
        
        If you want to **download all followees of a given profile**, call
        
        ::
        
            instaloader --login=your_username @profile
        
        To **download all the pictures from your feed which you have liked**, call
        
        ::
        
            instaloader --login=your_username :feed-liked
        
        The ``--quiet`` option makes it also **suitable as a cron job**.
        
        To get a list of other helpful flags, run ``instaloader --help``.
        
        Usage as library
        ----------------
        
        You may also use parts of Instaloader as library to do other interesting
        things.
        
        For example, to get a list of all followers of a profile as well as
        their follower count, do
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import instaloader
        
            # login
            session = instaloader.get_logged_in_session(USERNAME)
        
            # get followees
            followees = instaloader.get_followees(PROFILE, session)
            for f in followees:
                print("%i\t%s\t%s" % (f['follower_count'], f['username'], f['full_name']))
        
        Then, you may download all pictures of all followees with
        
        .. code:: python
        
            for f in followees:
                try:
                    instaloader.download(f['username'], session)
                except instaloader.NonfatalException:
                    pass
        
        You could also download your last 20 liked pics with
        
        .. code:: python
        
            instaloader.download_feed_pics(session, max_count=20, fast_update=True,
                                           filter_func=lambda node: not node["likes"]["viewer_has_liked"])
        
        Each Instagram profile has its own unique ID which stays unmodified even
        if a user changes his/her username. To get said ID, given the profile's
        name, you may call
        
        .. code:: python
        
            instaloader.get_id_by_username(PROFILE_NAME)
        
        ``get_followees()`` also returns unique IDs for all loaded followees. To
        get the current username of a profile, given this unique ID
        ``get_username_by_id()`` can be used. For example:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            instaloader.get_username_by_id(session, followees[0]['id'])
