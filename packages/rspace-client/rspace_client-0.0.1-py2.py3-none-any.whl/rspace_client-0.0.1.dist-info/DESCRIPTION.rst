# rspace-client-python

This project contains a client which helps calling RSpace APIs. There are some example Python scripts.

To begin with you'll need an account on an RSpace server and an API key which you can get from your profile page.

In these examples we'll be using the rspace_client package (code is in rspace_client folder) which provides an abstraction over lower-level libraries.

All the code listed here is in the project.

For full details of our API spec please see https://your.rspace.com/public/apiDocs

To run the example scripts in the root folder, cd to that folder, then run

```bash
python3 ExampleScript.py https://your.rspace.com MyAPIKey
```

replacing MyAPIKey with your key, and ExampleScript.py with the name of the script you want to run.
