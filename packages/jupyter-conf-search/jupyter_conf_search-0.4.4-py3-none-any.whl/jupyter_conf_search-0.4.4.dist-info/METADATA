In order to use this

::

    pip install jupyter_conf_search 

Which is then executed as

::

    jupyter_conf_search "your_search_term"

on the command line to search for "``your_search_term``".

If you pass just

::

    jupyter_conf_search

it will return the total list of configuration files that it found
relative to the directory that you are running the command from (not
just the directories, which you can find using ``jupyter --paths``
beneath ``config:``).
