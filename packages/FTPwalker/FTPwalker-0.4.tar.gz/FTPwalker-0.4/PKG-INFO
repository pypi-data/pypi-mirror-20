Description: FTPwalker is a Python package for optimally traversing extremely large FTP directory trees.
        
        Here is an example of FTPwalker traversing the Uniprot_ bioinformatics database:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        	from FTPwalker.runwalker import ftpwalker
        
        	walker = ftpwalker("Uniprot", "ftp.uniprot.org")
        	walker.check_state()
        
        
        
        This will create a dictionary formatted as a JSON file in the userâ€™s home directory containing all the full paths as keys and the respective filenames as values. FTPwalker is designed with speed in mind by utilizing state-of-the-art high performance parallelism and concurrency algorithms to traverse FTP directory trees. The resultant hash table (i.e., dictionary) supports fast lookup for any file in any biological database.
        
        
        Installation:
        
        For running the FTPwalker you need to have python3.x+ installed. Then you can use `pip` or `pip3` for installation. 
        
        .. code-block:: python
