Description: FTPwalker is a Python package for optimally traversing extremely large FTP directory trees.
        
        Here is an example of FTPwalker traversing the miRBase bioinformatics database:
        
        ```
        from runwalker import ftpwalker
        
        walker = ftpwalker('miRBase', 'mirbase.org', daemon=True)
        walker.chek_state()
        ```
        
        
        This will create a dictionary formatted as a JSON file in the userâ€™s home directory containing all the full paths as keys and the respective filenames as values. FTPwalker is designed with speed in mind by utilizing state-of-the-art high performance parallelism and concurrency algorithms to traverse FTP directory trees. The resultant hash table (i.e., dictionary) supports fast lookup for any file in any biological database.
