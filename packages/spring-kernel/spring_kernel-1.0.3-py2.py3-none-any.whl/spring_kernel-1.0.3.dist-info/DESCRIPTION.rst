SpringRTS IPython kernel for Jupyter notebooks

Run Spring code remotely via Jupyter notebooks.
4X: explore, experiment, extend and execute.

For usage docs see `%help and %lsmagic` inside the notebook.

Install
=======

Obtain a writable Python environment (virtualenv is suggested).

Install with pip:
```
pip install spring-kernel
```

Install the kernel (you probably want to include --user):
```
jupyter spring_kernel install --user
```

Install the widget and gadget to your Spring project.
Copy spring-kernel to your project's libs folder, and then copy the `api_spring_kernel_load.lua` to the `LuaUI/widgets` and `LuaRules/gadgets` folders.

Running
=======

Start your Spring project, and then start the jupyter notebook with:
```
jupyter notebook
```

You can then create SpringRTS kernel notebooks in the browser.
