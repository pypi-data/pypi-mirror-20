# Blingtron

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ImageIntelligence/blingtron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ImageIntelligence/blingtron)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/blingtron.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/blingtron)

**Welcome to Blingtron!**

> Assembles the upgraded [Blingtron 5000](http://www.wowhead.com/item=111821/blingtron-5000), a savage, yet generous, robot. While he will give out gifts to players once per day, he will also fight other Blingtron units to the death. (4 Hrs Cooldown)

Blingtron is a simple command line too (CLI) aimed at helping developers run their Image Intelligence projects.

## Installation

```
$ pip install blingtron
```

Projects that use Blingtron are expected to have a `bling.json` file at the root of the project directory structure. For an example of what a bling.json file might look like, checkout [bling.example.json](./bling.example.json).

* `name`: The name of your project
* `registry`: The username of your account for your image registry
* `run`: The command that's executed when a Docker container runs your image (remotely)
* `start`: The arguments passed into `docker run`(locally)
* `packer`: The location of your Packer configuration directory
* `packer_exec_path`: (optional) The absolute path to your Packer executable
* `env`: An object of custom environ variables you can pass into all `bling` commands

See [imageintelligence/skeleton-python](https://github.com/ImageIntelligence/skeleton-python) and [imageintelligence/skeleton-scala](https://github.com/ImageIntelligence/skeleton-scala) for more examples.
