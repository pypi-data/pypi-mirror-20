Change History
==============

0.4.0 (3rd March 2017)
 - Ensure actual syntax errors get reported to the client.

0.3.0 (23rd August 2016)
 - **Behaviour change** aiomanhole no longer attempts to remove the UNIX socket
   on shutdown. This was flakey behaviour and does not match best practice
   (i.e. removing the UNIX socket on startup before you start your server). As
   a result, errors creating the manhole will now be logged instead of silently
   failing.
 - `start_manhole` now returns a Future that you can wait on.
 - Giving a loop to `start_manhole` now works more reliably. This won't matter
   for most people.
