This is a hackable python based HTTP/HTTPS benchmarking tool.
It supports traffic proxying for both HTTP and HTTPS, thus also can be used to
test performance of proxy servers.

It is implemented with asyncio and runs on Python >= 3.5.
You can optionally use `uvloop <https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop>`_ for
better performance.

Usage
=====

::

    pip3 install httpmeter

Synopsis::

    httpmeter [options] URL

Options::

    -h  Display usage information.

    -c, --concurrency <N>
        How many requests should be executed in parallel.

    -n, requests <N>
        How many requests to make in total.

    -H, --header <custom-header>
        Additional headers to send with every request. Multiple entries
        allowed. E.g.
            --header "Connection: close" --header "User-Agent: benchmark"

    -X, --proxy <http://user:pass@proxy:port>
        Proxy address. E.g. http://user1:pass123@localhost:8080

    --uvloop
        Use uvloop to increase networking performance.

    -p N, --process-count N
        Use N processes to distribute requests over separate CPU cores.
        By default uses the same number of processes as there are CPU
        cores.
