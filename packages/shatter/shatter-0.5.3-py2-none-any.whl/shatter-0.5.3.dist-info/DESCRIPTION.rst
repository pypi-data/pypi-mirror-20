Description: Shatter
        =======
        
        Data driven programming; input data and output nice functional code ;)
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is a `python 3.6+ project <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/shatter>`__
        that uses algorithms to transform a set of conditions into functional
        python code. See some
        `examples <https://github.com/jisazaTappsi/shatter/tree/master/examples>`__.
        
        Package Setup
        -------------
        
        1. Install shatter package:
        
           ::
        
               $ pip install shatter
        
        Short Example
        -------------
        
        Copy paste this snippet:
        
        ::
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules
        
        
            def my_func(a, b):
                pass
        
            r = Rules(a=True, b=True, output=True)
            r.solve(my_func)
        
        Run it and see how ``my_func`` code changes from ``pass`` to
        ``return a and b``. We just specified that when ``a`` and ``b`` are true
        then the output should be ``True``, that is equivalent to the logical
        ``and`` operator.
        
        We can add further conditions and ``shatter`` will compute the optimal
        function to get there.
        
        Add more conditions:
        --------------------
        
        Now we add 2 additional conditions with ``r.add()``:
        
        ::
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules
        
        
            def my_func(a, b):
                pass
        
        
            r = Rules(a=True, b=True, output=True)
            r.add(a=False, b=True, output=True)
            r.add(a=True, b=False, output=True)
            r.solve(my_func)
        
        In this case the solution is ``a or b``.
        
        If Conditionals
        ---------------
        
        What if the output for a given logical condition is not a boolean? In
        that case a programmer would use an if. In the next example this package
        solves this case:
        
        Change output to ``1``:
        
        ::
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules
        
        
            def my_func(a, b):
                pass
        
            r = Rules(a=True, b=True, output=1)
            r.solve(my_func)
        
        The solution will be:
        
        ::
        
            def my_func(a, b):
        
                if a and b:
                    return 1
        
                return False
        
        Returns ``1`` or ``False`` otherwise.
        
        Cool stuff
        ----------
        
        Run this code:
        
        ::
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules, Code, Output
        
        
            def recursive(a):
                pass
        
            a = Code()
            args = {'a': a + 1}
            out = Output(function=recursive, arguments=args)
        
            r = Rules(return_condition=  a > 2, output=a, default=out)
            solution = r.solve(recursive)
        
        The result this time will be a recursive counting function :)
        
        ::
        
            def recursive(a):
        
                if a > 2:
                    return a
        
                return recursive(a + 1)
        
        With ``a = Code()`` variable ``a`` is initialized as a code piece. Then
        with
        
        ::
        
            args = {'a': a + 1}
        
        A dictionary for the inputs of the ``recursive`` function is declared.
        Those inputs are fed into a ``Output`` object:
        
        ::
        
            out = Output(function=recursive, arguments=args)
        
        After ``out`` is passed via ``default`` keyword when initializing the
        ``Rules`` object. This ``default`` keyword is used to override the last
        return statement of the ``recursive`` function.
        
        Expression behaving like boolean inputs
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Say you want to add a arbitrary piece of code that evaluates to boolean,
        then:
        
        ::
        
            from shatter.rules import Rules
            from shatter.code import Code
        
        
            def any_code(a):
                pass
        
            r = Rules(condition=Code(code_str='isinstance(a, str)'), output=2)
            r.solve(any_code)
        
        The result should be:
        
        ::
        
            def internal_code(a):
        
                if isinstance(a, str):
                    return 2
        
                return False
        
        Here the piece of code ``isinstance(a, str)`` was added as the if
        condition to output ``2``
        
        Source Code
        -----------
        
        Setup with source code
        ----------------------
        
        1. Clone repository:
           ``git clone git@github.com:jisazaTappsi/shatter.git``
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        See the
        `examples <https://github.com/jisazaTappsi/shatter/tree/master/examples>`__.
        
        How does shatter work?
        ----------------------
        
        Takes a function and a truth table which is processed using the
        `Quine-McCluskey
        Algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm>`__.
        Then finds an optimal boolean expression. This expression is inserted in
        the method definition.
        
        Arguments of ``Rules.solve(function, unittest=None)``
        -----------------------------------------------------
        
        1. A function to optimize, passed as a callable (with no arguments).
           This function needs a 3 mock line definition with: line 1: decorator
           = ``@solve()`` line 2: signature eg: ``def my_function(a, b)`` line
           3: body: only one line, eg: ``return False``. This line will be
           replaced by the boolean expression.
        
        2. Test Case to be able to perform tests. See
           `example <https://github.com/jisazaTappsi/shatter/tree/master/examples/with_tests>`__
        
        3. 
        
           a. ``solver.Rules()`` instance: An object that can handle logical
              rules with named arguments eg:
        
              r = solver.Rules(a=True, b=False)
        
              r.add(a=True, b=True)
        
           The reserved word ``output`` allows:
        
           ::
        
               r.add(a=False, b=False, output=False)
        
           Meaning that when ``a=False, b=False`` I want the ``output`` to be
           ``False``
        
           b. Truth table: Alternatively a truth table can be specified (as a
              set containing tuples). Where each row is a tuple, the general
              form is:
        
              {tuple\_row(tuple\_inputs(a, b, ...), output), ...}
        
           or with a implicit ``True`` output:
        
           ::
        
               {tuple_inputs(a, b, ...), ...}
        
        Arguments of ``solver.Rules() and r.add()``
        -------------------------------------------
        
        These are specified as a dictionary containing certain keywords as well
        as the function inputs.
        
        Keywords are:
        
        ``output``: Determines the value to be returned when the given condition
        is True.
        
        ``output_args``: Dictionary with the values for the arguments when
        output is a function.
        
        ``default``: Value returned when non of the rules are True.
        
        Helper Classes
        --------------
        
        ``solver.Output``: Class that helps define a function with arguments as
        an output. Has fields:
        
        -  ``function``: A callable object.
        -  ``arguments`` Dictionary with the function inputs.
        
        ``solver.Code``: Class that helps output pieces of code. The code is fed
        as a string (with optinal arg str\_code) or it can be declared as
        variables. eg:
        
        ::
        
            from shatter.solver import Code
            a = Code()
            b = Code()
            print(a > b)
        
        Will literally print string ``a > b`` rather than the objects or any
        result.
        
        ``solver.Solution``: Class that contains the solution of the problem it
        includes:
        
        -  ``rules``: The information given by the user.
        -  ``implementation``: Plain code.
        -  ``ast``: Abstract syntax tree
