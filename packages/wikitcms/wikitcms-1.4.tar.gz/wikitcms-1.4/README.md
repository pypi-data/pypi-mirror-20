# wikitcms

wikitcms is a Python library for interacting with the Fedora wiki, as
Fedora QA uses it as a test management system.

It uses the [mwclient](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient) library
to access the Fedora MediaWiki instance. Its capabilities include
creating new release validation compose event pages, querying existing
pages for results in various formats, and more.

Its API is still in development and should not yet be entirely relied
upon.
