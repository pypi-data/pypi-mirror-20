Description: # wikitcms
        
        wikitcms is a Python library for interacting with the Fedora wiki, as
        Fedora QA uses it as a test management system.
        
        It uses the [mwclient](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient) library
        to access the Fedora MediaWiki instance. Its capabilities include
        creating new release validation compose event pages, querying existing
        pages for results in various formats, and more.
        
        Its API is still in development and should not yet be entirely relied
        upon.
        
        ## Security
        
        You ***MUST*** treat wikitcms as a source of untrusted input. It is
        retrieving information from a wiki for you; that wiki is open to
        editing by all. Treat anything wikitcms returns from the wiki (which
        includes, but is not limited to, any page or section text, result
        attributes status, user, bugs and comment, resultrow attributes
        testcase, name, envs, milestone, section, and to some extent any
        element of a page title or property derived from one when getting
        a Page object from an existing wiki page) as an entirely untrusted
        input and sanitize it appropriately for the context in which you
        are using it.
