Description: # wikitcms
        
        wikitcms is a Python library for interacting with the Fedora wiki, as
        Fedora QA uses it as a test management system.
        
        It uses the [mwclient](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient) library
        to access the Fedora MediaWiki instance. Its capabilities include
        creating new release validation compose event pages, querying existing
        pages for results in various formats, and more.
        
        Its API is still in development and should not yet be entirely relied
        upon.
