[General Predicate Filtering]
allow_disconnected_dmrs: False
filter:
    ## Uncommented lines indicate filtered gpreds

    ## Quantifier-like things (*_q_* indicates a quantifier gpred)
    ## When you don't have an explicit quantifier, it's added as a grammar quantifier

    ## Occurs with 'he' etc., always occurs with 'pron_rel'. It doesn't shown anything interesting.
    pronoun_q_rel

    ## These don't occur in newer versions of the grammar anymore
    focus_d_rel,parg_d_rel

    ## Shows up with e.g. 'Three bark' (dogs). 'three' is being treated as a noun
    number_q_rel

    ## Part of an idiom (indicated by '_i_') when there is no other explicit quantifier for idiom (?)
    idiom_q_i_rel

    ## Quantifier for proper names. Shows distinction between explicitly quantifier proper names
    ## e.g. 'The Kim I saw yesterday' vs. 'Kim jumped up a tree' (last one has proper_q_rel)
    ## Almost always present, so it can be removed to reduce complexity.
    proper_q_rel

    ## If it doesn't have any other quantifier, it's this.
    ## Mostly harmless, without a strong signal. Can be removed to decrease complexity.
    udef_q_rel

    ## Used for things like possesive 'her', 'whose'.
    ## (investigate further! - found in dates too)
    def_explicit_q_rel,def_implicit_q_rel

    ## // end quantifier-like things

    ## Signifies when copulas can't be treated implicitly.
    ## e.g. 'Kim is president' as opposed to 'Kim is tall'
    cop_id_rel

    ## Signifying a gap in a sentence, e.g. 'Kim doesn't know when' [...]
    ## They are supposed to happen here. They often happen due to misparse,
    ## which is why we filter them by default.

    ## e.g. 'Playing is fun'
    # nominalization_rel

    ## Preposition-like gpreds

    ## Corresponds to 'in' in what manner
    ## e.g. 'How did Kim fall' (in what manner did Kim fall?)
    # unspec_manner_rel

    ## Indicates noun-noun compounds, preposition-like
    ## e.g. 'Kim Smith'
