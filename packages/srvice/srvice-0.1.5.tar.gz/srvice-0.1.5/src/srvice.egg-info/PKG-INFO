Description: Srvice is a library that aims to integrate a Python server with a Javascript
        client via remote calls. With Srvice, the client can transparently call
        functions defined in server. The server might also respond with instructions
        that execute arbitrary Javascript code in the client.
        
        Let us define a function in the client:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from import srvice
        
            @srvice.api
            def get_user_email(request, username):
                if can_read_email(request.user, username):
                    return email_from_username(username)
                else:
                    raise PermissionError
        
            # This function must be associated with some url in your application
            urlpatterns [
                ...,
                '^get-user-email/$', get_user_email.as_view(),
            ]
        
        
        In the client, we call the function defined in the some URL point using the
        srvice object:
        
        .. code-block:: javascript
        
            srvice.call('get-user-email', 'paulmcartney').then(function (email) {
                var contact = currentContact();
                contact.email = email;
            })
        
        
        Communication is done using JSON strings that pass function arguments and
        results from client to server and vice-versa.
        
        This is only the very basic that Srvice can do. Please check the documentation
        for more information.
