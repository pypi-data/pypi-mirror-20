RTk Python Library
=====

This library contains 2 main modules. GPIO and smbus.

The RTk.GPIO Library aims to replicate most functions found in the RPi.GPIO Library. You should be able to use existing code and tutorials by changing "RPi.GPIO" to "RTk.GPIO".
You can also import it using either "from RTk import GPIO" or "import RTk.GPIO as GPIO" like you can with RPi.GPIO.

The RTk.smbus library aims to replicate the python-smbus library used to access I2C devices on the Raspberry Pi. You can import it by importing "RTk.smbus".

Documentation can be found on our wiki on how to use these.
