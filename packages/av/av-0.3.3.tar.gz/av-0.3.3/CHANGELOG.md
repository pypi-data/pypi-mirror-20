We are operating with semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>. However,
we are using v0.x.y as our heavy development period, and will increment `x`
to signal a major change (i.e. backwards incompatibilities) and increment
`y` as a minor change (i.e. backwards compatible features).


0.3.3
=====

Fixes:
- Fix segfault due to buffer overflow in handling of stream options.
  (#163 and #169.)
- Fix segfault due to seek not properly checking if codecs were open before
  using avcodec_flush_buffers. (#201.)


0.3.2
=====

Minor:
- Expose basics of avfilter via `Filter`.
- Add `Packet.time_base`.
- Add `AudioFrame.to_nd_array` to match same on `VideoFrame`.
- Update Windows build process.

Fixes:
- Further improvements to the logging system, continued from #128.


0.3.1
=====

Minor:
- `av.logging.set_log_after_shutdown` renamed to `set_print_after_shutdown`
- Repeating log messages will be skipped, much like ffmpeg's does by default

Fixes:
- Fix memory leak in logging system when under heavy logging loads while
  threading (#128 with help from @mkassner and @ksze)


0.3.0
=====

Major:
- Python IO can write
- Improve build system to use Python's C compiler for function detection;
  build system is much more robust
- MSVC support (#115 by @vidartf)
- Continuous integration on Windows via AppVeyor (by @vidartf)

Minor:
- Add `Packet.decode_one()` to skip packet flushing for codecs that would
  otherwise error
- `StreamContainer` for easier selection of streams
- Add buffer protocol support to Packet

Fixes:
- Fix bug when using Python IO on files larger than 2GB (#109 by @xxr3376)
- Fix usage of changed Pillow API

Known Issues:
- VideoFrame is suspected to leak memory in narrow cases on Linux (#128)


0.2.4
=====
- fix library search path for current Libav/Ubuntu 14.04 (#97)
- explicitly include all sources to combat 0.2.3 release problem (#100)


0.2.3
=====

WARNING: There was an issue with the PyPI distribution in which it required
Cython to be installed.

Major:
- Python IO.
- Agressively releases GIL
- Add experimental Windows build (#84)

Minor:
- Several new Stream/Packet/Frame attributes

Fixes:
- Fix segfault in audio handling (#86 and #93)
- Fix use of PIL/Pillow API (#85)
- Fix bad assumptions about plane counts (#76)


0.2.2
=====
- Cythonization in setup.py; mostly a development issue.
- Fix for av.InputContainer.size over 2**31.


0.2.1
=====
- Python 3 compatibility!
- Build process fails if missing libraries.
- Fix linking of libavdevices.


0.2.0
=====

WARNING: This version has an issue linking in libavdevices, and very likely
will not work for you.

It sure has been a long time since this was released, and there was a lot of
arbitrary changes that come with us wrapping an API as we are discovering it.
Changes include, but are not limited to:

- Audio encoding.
- Exposing planes and buffers.
- Descriptors for channel layouts, video and audio formats, etc..
- Seeking.
- Many many more properties on all of the objects.
- Device support (e.g. webcams).


0.1.0
=====
- FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE!
- Container/video/audio formats.
- Audio layouts.
- Decoding video/audio/subtitles.
- Encoding video.
- Audio FIFOs and resampling.
