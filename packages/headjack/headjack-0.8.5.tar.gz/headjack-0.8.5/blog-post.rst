Importing Media into Devonthink
-------------------------------

The `headjack dt` command can be used to import media content into a devonthink database. The content is organised by media-kind and it's possible to populate all of the media's associated metadata fields (tags, ratings etc) at the point of import.

The media content to be imported into devonthink must be organised in the import folder in a specific manner. Take the 'Volkswagen - Wikipedia' article for example (`grab the test data here <https://github.com/thespacedoctor/headjack/blob/master/headjack/archiver/tests/input/st-devonthink.zip?raw=true>`_):

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/x7VCSFv.png
    :width: 800px

The content is added to a folder whose name indicates the kind of media-content contained (e.g. 'web-articles', 'podcasts' etc). The content itself is a folder named with the media-title (e.g. a web-article called 'Volkswagen - Wikipedia'). The folder contains files related to the content (e.g. the web-article in webarchive, epub and PDF format and a markdown file of notes). Finally there is a yaml file containing a rating, tags etc.

.. code-block:: yaml

    title: Volkswagen - Wikipedia
    rating: 3
    tags:
      - car
      - volkswagen
      - germany
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen
    kind: web-article

Note without this yaml file the content will be passed over and not imported into devonthink. 

To import this media into my *home reference* devonthink database I run the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    headjack dt "/Users/Me/process/st-devonthink" "/Users/Me/devonthink/home reference.dtBase2

This imports the media into a 'web-articles' group in the devonthink database given:

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/FlWsqwQ.png
    :width: 800px

The metadata fields are populated including tags, rating (as a devonthink label) and the URL field if given in the yaml metadata. Note for tagging to work you will have to install `jdberry's 'tag' <https://github.com/jdberry/tag>`_ (a command line tool to manipulate tags on Mac OS X files, and to query for files with those tags.)

To setup regular automated imports just add the command into your crontab (or use another service like Hazel or Keyboard Maestro).

    - add tutorial here about annotation highlights and note and how they get converted to MMD

Converting Embedded Journal Photos in Marvin to MMD Image Links
---------------------------------------------------------------

In the Marvin ebook reader, if you want to add an image into the
extracted MMD annotation notes first copy the image you want onto your
device. Then highlight a section of text close to the position you would
like the image to appear in your extracted MMD annotations [1]_ and
choose to add a journal entry to the selected text. Select the image you
want to add by tapping on the camera icon at the bottom right of the
screen and then choosing your image.

.. figure:: https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2144/32254004553_1e9ea45058_o.png
   :width: 400px

Once the book has been marked as read, and before the headjack exports
the annotations to MMD, the image will be uploaded to flickr via picaxe
and headjack saves the resulting MMD image link to export later. A few
details to note are that the images uploaded are set to private (but
anyone can view the MMD image link) and are uploaded to a *web-article
images* album. There are also 3 optional variables you should be aware
of; the first line of the note (if it exists) is added as the image
title, all other text is added as the image description and journal
entry tags are mirrored in the flickr image tags.

.. [1]
   choose a yellow highlight to disregard the selected text and simply
   use it as a placeholder for your image, or green to also extract the
   selected text into your MMD annotation notes.
    

Importing the Marvin iOS Ebook Reader's Database into Headjack's MySQL Database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've read a few ebooks in the Marvin iOS app, marked them up with highlights, notes and tags, rated them and marked them as read, it is now time to export the contents of the app to somewhere on your Dropbox path.

In the Marvin app go to '*Settings > General Settings*' and scroll to the bottom of the menu. Here you should see '*Backup and restore*', select this and then '*Backup now*'.

        :alt: backup and restore in Marvin

Once the backup has completed choose to '*Send it*' and select '*import with Dropbox*' as the share action. I usually back the zip file up to a '*headjack*' folder at the root of my Dropbox account.

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/FkxTScp.png
        :width: 400px

Once the backup has synced to the machine you have headjack installed on, run the command:

.. code-block:: bash 

  headjack import marvin ~/Dropbox/headjack/marvin.m3backup

This will unzip the backup and sync Marvin's sqlite database into your headjack database so now you have a local copy of the annotations, tags and notes from all you books.
