Swiftwind for Heroku Deployment
===============================

For more details see the `Swiftwind project`_.

Installation
------------

.. image:: https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg
    :target: https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/adamcharnock/swiftwind-heroku

Environment variables::

    # Should be setup automatically for you:
    SECRET_KEY='<a random value>'
    DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:pasword@host/dbname'

    # If you are using HTTPS you may wish to set the following yourself:
    HTTPS=1  # Will ensure site is served over HTTPS only
    HSTS_SECONDS=100000  # Will enable HSTS, and set the seconds timeout
    HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS=1  # Apply HSTS to subdomains

Required Heroku Addons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The free plan for each of the following addons will be setup:

* Postgres
* Redis

Dokku
~~~~~

This project is also designed to support deployment to dokku. To do so you will need:

* A Postgres database (See `Postgres Dokku plugin`_)
* A Redis server (`Redis Dokku plugin`_)

You can deploy as follows::

    # Get the repo
    git clone https://github.com/adamcharnock/swiftwind-heroku.git
    cd swiftwind-heroku

    # Create the app and set the config
    dokku apps:create swiftwind
    dokku config:set SECRET_KEY=random-string

    dokku postgres:create swiftwind
    dokku postgres:link swiftwind swiftwind

    dokku redis:create swiftwind
    dokku redis:link swiftwind swiftwind

    git push dokku
    dokku run ./manage.py migrate
    # Create a user you will use to login as
    dokku run ./manage.py createsuperuser
    # Set currency as you wish (GBP, EUR, USD etc)
    dokku run ./manage.py swiftwind_create_accounts --currency USD

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django does not display very helpful errors when deploying into production, and for good reason.
However, you can enable debugging output to help fix any server errors you may see
when accessing sentry in your browser::

    heroku config:set DEBUG=1
    heroku config:unset DEBUG

You can also view the server logs::

    heroku logs -t

Note you can replace ``heroku`` with ``dokku`` in any of the above commands.
