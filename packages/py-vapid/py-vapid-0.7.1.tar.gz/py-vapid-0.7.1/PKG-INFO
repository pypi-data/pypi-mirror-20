Description: # Easy VAPID generation
        
        This minimal library contains the minimal set of functions you need to
        generate a VAPID key set and get the headers you'll need to sign a
        WebPush subscription update.
        
        This can either be installed as a library or used as a stand along
        app.
        
        ## App Installation
        
        You'll need `python virtualenv` Run that in the current directory.
        
        Then run
        ```
        bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        bin/python setup.py`install
        ```
        ## App Usage
        
        Run by itself, `bin/vapid` will check and optionally create the
        public_key.pem and private_key.pem files.
        
        `bin/vapid --sign _claims.json_` will generate a set of HTTP headers
        from a JSON formatted claims file. A sample `claims.json` is included
        with this distribution.
        
        `bin/vapid --validate _token_` will generate a token response for the
        Mozilla WebPush dashboard.
