PyLMNN
======

**PyLMNN** is a python implementation of the `Large Margin Nearest
Neighbor <#paper>`__ algorithm for metric learning.

This implementation follows closely the original MATLAB code by Kilian
Weinberger found at https://bitbucket.org/mlcircus/lmnn. This version
solves the unconstrained optimisation problem and finds a linear
transformation using L-BFGS as the backend optimizer.

This package also uses Bayesian Optimization to find the optimal
hyper-parameters for LMNN using the excellent
`GPyOpt <http://github.com/SheffieldML/GPyOpt>`__ package.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code was developed in python 3.5 under Ubuntu 16.04. You can clone
the repo with:

::

    git clone https://github.com/johny-c/pylmnn.git

or install it via pip:

::

    pip3 install pylmnn

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  numpy>=1.11.2
-  scipy>=0.18.1
-  scikit\_learn>=0.18.1
-  GPy>=1.5.6
-  GPyOpt>=1.0.3
-  matplotlib>=1.5.3

Usage
^^^^^

The simplest use case would be something like:

::

    X, y = load_my_data(dataset_name)
    x_tr, x_te, y_tr, y_te = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.5, stratify=y)
    k_tr, k_te, dim_out, max_iter = 3, 1, X.shape[1], 180
    lmnn = LMNN(k=k_tr, max_iter=max_iter, dim_out=dim_out)
    lmnn = lmnn.fit(x_tr, y_tr)
    test_acc = test_knn(x_tr, y_tr, x_te, y_te, k=k_te, L=lmnn.L)

You can check the examples directory for examples of how to use the
code.
