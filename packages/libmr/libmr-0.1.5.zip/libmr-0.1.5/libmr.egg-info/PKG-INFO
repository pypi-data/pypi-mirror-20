        =====
        
        
        libMR provides core MetaRecognition and  Weibull fitting functionality.
        It is used to calculate w-scores used for multi-modal fusion.
        This version uses object, that retain the "transforms" (including save/load) need to compute the actual w-scores.
        It includes functions  for Prediction, CDF,  Inverse, FitHigh (larger is better), FitLow (smaller is better) and FitSVM.
