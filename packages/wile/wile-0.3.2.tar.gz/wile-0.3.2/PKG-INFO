        # Overview
        
        Wile is a simple [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) (ACME) client that only supports the "webroot" method of validation. It only needs access to the root folder serving the domanis in question. Specifically, it only needs access to the `.well-known` sub-folder and therefore doesn't need root permissions.
        
        The `.well-known` folder must also be accessible from external sources. I.e.: if you run a reverse proxy for some backend application, it should include an exception for this folder.
        
        Per default, no new request will be made if wile detects an existing certificate for the same requested domains with a validity of more than 25 hours, 1 day plus 1 hour safety margin. This can be changed with the `--min-valid-time` and `--force` options.
        
        # Usage
        
        Simple anonymous certificate request:
        ```
        $ wile cert request example.com:/var/www/example.com/
        ```
        
        Registration with contact information, and saving certs to some other location (default saves to current folder):
        ```
        $ wile register -e name@example.com
        $ wile cert request --output-dir /etc/ssl/private/ example.com:/var/www/example.com/
        ```
        
        Revoking a certificate:
        ```
        $ wile cert revoke /etc/ssl/private/example.com.crt
        ```
        
        Note that you can also pass multiple domains with a single document root, which creates a certificate with [Subject Alternative Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name).
        ```
        $ wile cert request example.com:/var/www/example.com/ www.example.com
        ```
        
        You can also increase the default minimal validity time to one week, if you intend on running wile via a weekly cronjob:
        ```
        $ wile cert request --min-valid-time 1w example.com:/var/www/example.com/
        ```
        Adding some safety margin, `--min-valid-time 8d` or `--min-valid-time $((24*7+1))h` are recommended for weekly cron operation.
