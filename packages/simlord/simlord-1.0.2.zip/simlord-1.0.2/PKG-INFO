        SimLoRD - Simulate long Read Data
        ---------------------------------
        
        SimLoRD is a read simulator for third generation sequencing reads and is
        currently focused on the Pacific Biosciences SMRT error model.
        
        Reads are simulated from both strands of a provided or randomly
        generated reference sequence.
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        -  The reference can be read from a FASTA file or randomly generated
           with a given GC content. It can consist of several chromosomes, whose
           structure is respected when drawing reads. (Simulation of genome
           rearrangements may be incorporated at a later stage.)
        -  The read lengths can be determined in four ways: drawing from a
           log-normal distribution (typical for genomic DNA), sampling from an
           existing FASTQ file (typical for RNA), sampling from a a text file
           with integers (RNA), or using a fixed length
        -  Quality values and number of passes depend on fragment length.
        -  Provided subread error probabilities are modified according to number
           of passes
        -  Outputs reads in FASTQ format and alignments in SAM format
        
        System requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  `python3 <https://www.python.org/>`__
        -  `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__
        -  `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__
        -  `pysam <http://pysam.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
        -  `dinopy <https://bitbucket.org/HenningTimm/dinopy>`__
        
        We recommend using
        `miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html#miniconda>`__ and
        creating an environment for SimLoRD
        
        ::
        
            # Create and activate a new environment called simlord
            conda create -n simlord python=3 pip numpy scipy cython
            source activate simlord
        
            # Install packages that are not available with conda from pip
            pip install pysam
            pip install dinopy
            pip install simlord
        
            # You now have a 'simlord' script; try it:
            simlord --help
        
            # To switch back to your normal environment, use
            source deactivate
        
        Platform support
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        SimLoRD is a pure Python program. This means that it runs on any
        operating system (OS) for which Python 3 and the other packages are
        available.
        
        Example usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        **Example 1:** Simulate 10000 reads for the reference ref.fasta, use the
        default options for simulation and store the reads in ``myreads.fastq``
        and the alignment in ``myreads.sam``.
        
        
        ::
        
            simlord  --read-reference ref.fasta -n 10000  myreads
        
        
        **Example 2:** Generate a reference with 10 mio bases GC content 0.6
        (i.e., probability 0.3 for both C and G; thus 0.2 probability for both A
        and T), store the reference as random.fasta, and simulate 10000 reads
        with default options, store reads as ``myreads.fastq``, do not store
        alignments.
        
        ::
        
            simlord --generate-reference 0.6 10000000 --save-reference random.fasta\
                    -n 10000 --nosam  myreads
        
        
        **Example 3:** Simulate reads from the given ``reference.fasta``, using
        a fixed read length of 5000 and custom subread error probabilities (12%
        insertion, 12% deletion, 2% substitution). As before, save reads as
        ``myreads.fastq`` and ``myreads.sam``.
        
        ::
        
            simlord --read-reference reference.fasta  -n 10000 -fl 5000\
                    -pi 0.12 -pd 0.12 -ps 0.02  myreads
