Detailed Installation Instructions for Ginga
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

===========
Dependences
===========

Ginga is written entirely in Python, and only uses supporting Python
packages.  There is nothing to compile, unless you need to compile one
of the supporting packages.

On recent Linux, Mac and Windows versions, all of the packages are
available in binary (installable) form; it should not be necessary to
compile anything.  But as always, YMMV.

REQUIRED
========

* python (v. 2.7, 3.4 or higher)
* numpy  (v. 1.7 or higher)

Highly recommended, because some features will not be available without it:

* scipy

For opening FITS files you will need ONE of:

* astropy
* fitsio

For WCS resolution you will need ONE of:

* kapteyn
* astLib
* starlink
* astropy

BACKENDS (one or more)
======================
Ginga can draw it's output to a number of different back ends.
Depending on which GUI toolkit you prefer (and what you want to
do), you will need either:

* python-qt4

OR

* python-qt5

OR

* python-pyside (qt4 alternative)

OR

* python-gtk (gtk2) AND python-cairo

OR

* python gtk3 (gi) AND python-cairo

OR

* python-Tkinter

OR

* matplotlib

OR

* tornado

OR

* aggdraw

OR

* PIL (pillow)

OR

* OpenCv


RECOMMENDED
===========
Certain plugins in the reference viewer (or features of those plugins)
will not work without the following packages:

* matplotlib (Pick, Cuts, Histogram, LineProfile)
* webkit (WBrowser (online help))
* scipy (Pick, certain auto cuts algorithms)
* astropy (MultiDim, SAMP)

To save a movie:

* mencoder (Cuts)

Helpful, but not necessary (may optimize or speed up certain operations):

* python-opencv  (speeds up rotation and some transformations)
* python-pyopencl  (speeds up rotation and some transformations)
* python-numexpr  (speeds up rotation)
* python-filemagic (aids in identifying files when opening them)
* python-PIL or pillow (useful for various RGB file manipulations)

==============================
Notes on Supported Widget Sets
==============================

In the discussion below, we differentiate between the Ginga viewing
widget, such as used in the examples/\*/example\*.py programs and the full
reference viewer, which includes many plugins (scripts/ginga).

.. note:: For the full reference viewer, Mac and Windows users
	  should probably install the Qt version, unless you are
	  the tinkering sort.  Linux can use either Qt or Gtk fine.

Qt/PySide
=========

Ginga can use either PyQt or PySide, version 4 or 5.  It will auto-detect
which one is installed.  There is support for both the basic widget and
the full reference viewer.

.. note:: If you have both installed and you want to use a specific one
	  then set the environment variable QT_API to either "pyqt" or
	  "pyside".  This is the same procedure as for Matplotlib.


Gtk
===

Ginga can use either Gtk 2 (with pygtk) or gtk 3 (with gi).

Tk
===

Ginga's Tk support is limited to the viewing widget itself.  For
overplotting (graphics) support you also need the "pillow"/PIL package,
the Python "OpenCv" module, or the "aggdraw" module (which you can find 
`here <https://github.com/ejeschke/aggdraw>`_, supports Python 2 only).

Matplotlib
==========

Ginga can render directly into a Matplotlib figure.  Support is limited
to the viewing widget itself.  Any of the backends that Matplotlib
supports is usable.  Performance is not as good as to one of the
"native" backends listed above, but oh, the overplot options!

HTML5 web browser
=================

Ginga can render via a web server into an HTML5 canvas.  Support is limited
to the viewing widget itself.  See the notes in example/pg/example1_pg.py
Tested browsers include Chromium (Chrome), Firefox, Safari

========================
Installation from Source
========================

Clone from github::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga.git

Or see links on `this page <http://ejeschke.github.io/ginga/>`_
to get a zip or tar ball.

Unpack, go into the top level directory and::

    $ python setup.py install

The reference viewer can then be run using the command "ginga"

Alternatively you can download and install via `pip`::

    $ pip install ginga

==============================
Platform Specific Instructions
==============================

Linux
=====

Install the necessary dependences.  If you are on a relatively recent
version of Ubuntu (e.g. v14.04 or later), something like the following
will work::

    $ apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib \
      python-astropy python-qt4 python-webkit python-magic git pip

Or::

    $ apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib \
      python-astropy python-gtk python-cairo python-webkit \
      python-magic git pip

(if you want to use the Gtk version)

Then install ginga with pip::

    $ pip install ginga

or by obtaining the source and installing as described above.


Mac
===

For Mac users, we recommend installing the
`Anaconda distribution <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_.
This distribution already includes all of the necessary packages to run
Ginga.

As an alternative, you also have the choice of Enthought Canopy.  The
`free version <https://www.enthought.com/canopy-express/>`_ works fine.
After installing this, open the Canopy package manager, search for
"astropy" and install it.  Also search for and install "pyside"
(free version of Qt bindings).

After installing one of these distributions, open a Terminal and
install Ginga via "pip install ginga".  You can then run the reference
viewer via the command "ginga".

Ginga can be installed and run fine using a working Macports or Homebrew
installation.  Simply follow the package advice given above under the
Linux instructions.

Windows
=======

For Windows users we recommend installing the
`Anaconda distribution <http://continuum.io/downloads>`.
This distribution already includes all of the necessary packages to run
Ginga.

After installing Anaconda, you can find the reference viewer script as

    Start -> All Programs -> Anaconda -> Anaconda Command Prompt
    pythonw Scripts\ginga

As an alternative, you also have the choice of Enthought Canopy.  The
`free version <https://www.enthought.com/canopy-express/>` works fine.
After installing this, open the Canopy package manager, search for
"astropy" and install it.  Also search for and install "pyside"
(free version of Qt bindings).

    Start -> All Programs -> Enthought Canopy -> Canopy command prompt
    pip install ginga
    pythonw AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User\Scripts\ginga
