### Windows + macOS Users

Native installers for Windows and macOS are available on the releases page with every new version, or just click the button below. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://github.com/ozmartian/vidcutter/releases/latest"><img alt="Latest Release" src="http://tvlinker.ozmartians.com/images/button-latest-release.png" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

### Linux Users

Install via PyPi as a last resort only if you are using a Linux distribution that is NOT related to ArchLinux or Ubuntu/Debian.

ArchLinux users can install directly from AUR, package is available in both stable and git-latest versions:

    AUR: vidcutter, vidcutter-git

Ubuntu/Mint/Debian users can install via Launchpad PPA.

    ppa:ozmartian/apps

If you are new to PPAs then just issue the following commands in a terminal:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ozmartian/apps
    sudo apt-get update

You should now be able to search for vidcutter in your chosen package management software (synaptic, Ubuntu software centre, apt-get etc.)
