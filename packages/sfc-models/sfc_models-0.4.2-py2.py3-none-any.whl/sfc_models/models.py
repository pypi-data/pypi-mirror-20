        """
        Routine that does most of the work of model building. The model is build based upon
        the Sector objects that have been registered as children of this Model.

        The base_file_name is the base filename that is used for Logging operations; just used
        to call Logger.register_standard_logs(base_file_name). It is recommended that you call
        Logger.register_standard_logs() before main, so that Sector creation can be logged.

        The major operations:
        [1] Call GenerateEquations() on all Sectors. The fact that GenerateEquations() is only
         called now at the Sector level means that Sectors can be created independently, and the
        GenerateEquations() call which ties it to other sectors is only called after all other sectors
        are created. (There is at least one exception where Sectors have to be created in a specific
        order, which we want to avoid.)

        [2] Cleanup work: processing initial conditions, exogenous variables, replacing
            aliases in equations.

        [3] Tie the sector level equations into a single block of equations. (Currently strings, not
            Equation objects.)

        [4] The equations are passed to self.EquationSolver, and they are solved.

        The user can then use GetTimeSeries() to access the output time series (if they can be
        calculated.)
