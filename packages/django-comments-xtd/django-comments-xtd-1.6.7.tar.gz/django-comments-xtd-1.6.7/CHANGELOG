	* Release 1.6.0:

	New flags have been added to allow users like/dislike comments.
	A new XtdCommentModerator classthat extends the
	django-contrib-comments CommentModerator with an option
	removal_suggestion_notification that when set to True will notify
	MANAGERS with an email indicating that a comment has received a
	removal suggestion. The class XtdModerator that registers moderation
	classes on models now is connected to the signal comment_was_flagged
	sent by the django-contrib-comments app when a comment is flagged.
	The tutorial has been updated with a new section on flagging.

	* views.py, forms.py, tests/test_moderation.py: Fixes bug #34,
	regarding moderation. Django-comments-xtd did set is_public to True
	no matter whether moderation required the attribute to be False.
	Tests has been added to ensure moderation works as expected.
