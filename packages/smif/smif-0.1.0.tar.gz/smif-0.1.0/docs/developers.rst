Developing `smif`
=================

*smif* is under active development at `github.com/nismod/smif`_


Testing
-------

We use `pytest`_ for testing, with tests under :code:`tests/` matching the module
and class structure of :code:`smif/`.

Install requirements for testing::

    pip install -r test-requirements.txt


Run tests::

    python setup.py test


Versioning
----------

:code:`smif` is currently pre-1.0, so API and usage are liable to change. After
releasing a first major version, we intend to follow `semantic versioning`_, with
major versions for any incompatible changes to the public API.


Conventions
-----------

The `numpydoc`_ docstring conventions are used for inline documentation, which
is used to generate the module reference documentation visible at `readthedocs`_
and which can also be generated by running ``python setup.py docs``

Linting is handled by `pre-commit`_ hooks, which can be installed from the root
of the repository using::

    pre-commit install
