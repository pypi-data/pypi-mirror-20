def create_dt_fpath(dt, root, fname, subdirs=[]):
    """
    Create filepaths from root + fname and a list of subdirectories.
    fname and subdirs will be put through dt.strftime.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dt: datetime.datetime
        date as basis for the URL
    root: string
        root of the filenpath
    fname: string
        filename to use
    subdirs: list, optional
        list of strings.
        Each element represents a subdirectory.
        For example the list ['%Y', '%m'] would lead to a URL of
        ``root/YYYY/MM/fname`` or for a dt of datetime(2000,12,31)
        ``root/2000/12/fname``

    Returns
    -------
    fpath: string
        Full filename including path
