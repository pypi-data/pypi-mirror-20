    """
    Identify a set of reactions that you should add to your model for growth because they contain orphan compounds

    This is a slightly different approach to suggesting by compound.
    We look for "orphan" compounds that only have a few connections to
    other reactions, and then add those to our network to see what
    happens.

    Note: that our notion of two compounds being equal normally
    includes their location (and str(c) includes the location).
    However, we probably have several instances of:

        cpd [e] -> cpd [c]
        and
        cpd [c] -> products

    These should be considered to be the same, and we probably
    don't want to consider external compounds any way
