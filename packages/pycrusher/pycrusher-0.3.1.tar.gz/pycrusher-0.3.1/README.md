# pyCrusher 0.3.1

**Crusher (Wikipedia):**
>Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled..."

Much like an actual crusher, *pyCrusher* copies your precious little images and turns them into absolute trash (for fun!)

## Installation
Install this program through pip:

Linux/MacOS:
```sh
sudo pip install -U pycrusher
```

Windows:
```sh
py -m pip install -U pycrusher
```

Or download this package and manually run:
```sh
sudo python setup.py install
```

If an ImportError happens (mostly Python 3), try running 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt'
```

## Usage:
Type in the command line:
```sh
~/path/to/somewhere $ pycrusher <image_file>
```
Windows:
```sh
C:\path\to\somewhere > py -m pycrusher <image_file>
```
As default, the program saves your output in a special directory called 'compressions' located at `path/to/somewhere`, so if you use *pyCrusher* multiple times in `path/to/somewhere`, you can check your compressed images without mixing it up between your other files.
Every time you save a new file in 'compressions', your output file will be saved with your input name followed by the compression settings. You can still use the -o/--output flag and name it however you want.

Default name: `compression/<image-name>_i<iterations>e<extra><r><p><c>[colors].<extension>`

### Options:

**-h, --help**

Display the help information.

**-i, --iterations ITERATIONS**

How many times you want your image to be compressed. Default: 50

**-e, --extra EXTRA**

How many times you want ITERATIONS to happen. Usually enforces the effect of ITERATIONS. Default: 1

**-c, --colors [COLOR, ...]**

Different saturation values you want the image to be post-processed with. They are read in order. Default: [1.0]

**-o, --output OUTFILENAME**

Name of output, which will also be saved in 'compressions'.

**-r, --reverse**

Flag that means file will compress image from worst quality to best, creating a 'blockier' image.

**-p, --preprocess**

Flag that applies color changes from -c, --colors before compressing, might create interesting effects.
