area\_under\_curve
==================

-  Python 3 module to calculate area under a curve
-  Supports simpson, trapezoid, and midpoint algorithms, n-degree single variable polynomials, and
   variable step size

``USAGE = """ -p|--poly {DegreeN1:CoefficientM1, DegreeN2:CoefficientM2, ...}...``
``-l|--lower <lower_bound> -u|--upper <upper_bound> -s|--step <step>``
``-a|--algorithm <simpson | trapezoid | midpoint>``

-  This was just a fun experiment I did on a couple airplane rides and might not be suitable for
   production use.
-  Try a simple function you can integrate by hand easily, like ``f(x) = x^3`` from ``[0-10]``, and
   compare that to how accurate the midpoint, trapezoid, and simpson approximations are with various
   steps sizes.

example:

``python area_under_curve.py --polynomial {3:1} --lower 0 --upper 10 --step .1 --algorithm simpson``

or:

``import area_under_curve as auc``

``algorithm = auc.get_algorithm("simpson")``

``bounds = auc.Bounds(0, 10, .1)``

``polynomial = auc.Polynomial({3:1})``

``params = auc.Parameters._make([polynomial, bounds, algorithm])``

``AREA = auc.area_under_curve(params.polynomial, params.bounds, params.algorithm)``

``print(str(AREA))``
