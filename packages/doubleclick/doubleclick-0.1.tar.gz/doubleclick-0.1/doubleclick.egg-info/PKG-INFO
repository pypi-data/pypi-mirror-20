Description: doubleclick
        ===========
        
        A small python library that collects helper functions commonly used in command
        line applications. Made after I wrote an ``exit_err`` function for the 5th
        time. The name stems from the excellent Python CLI library
        `click <http://click.pocoo.org>`_.
        
        Documentation after there is something substantial here. Move along...
