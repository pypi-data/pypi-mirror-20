doubleclick
===========

A small python library that collects helper functions commonly used in command
line applications. Made after I wrote an ``exit_err`` function for the 5th
time. The name stems from the excellent Python CLI library
`click <http://click.pocoo.org>`_.

Documentation after there is something substantial here. Move along...
