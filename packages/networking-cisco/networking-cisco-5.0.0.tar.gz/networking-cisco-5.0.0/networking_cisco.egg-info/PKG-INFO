        ----------------------------
        
        From Mitaka forward, networking-cisco is branchless and releases will be made
        from master. We have a goal to maintain compatibility with multiple versions of
        OpenStack for as long as possible starting from version 4.0.0 which is
        compatible with both Mitaka and Newton OpenStack releases.
        
        * 4.X.X Mitaka and Newton onwards
        * 3.X.X Mitaka
        * 2.X.X Liberty
