# pyodbc

pyodbc is an open source Python module that makes accessing ODBC databases simple.  It
implements the [DB API 2.0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249) specification but is
packed with even more Pythonic convenience.

The easiest way to install is to use pip:

    pip install pyodbc
    
Precompiled binary wheels are provided for most Python versions on Windows and macOS.  On other
operating systems this will build from source.
