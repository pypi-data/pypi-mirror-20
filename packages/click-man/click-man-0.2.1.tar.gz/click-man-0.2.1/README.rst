click-man
=========

|Build Status| |PyPI Package version|

Create **man pages** for `click <https://github.com/pallets/click>`__
application as easy as this:

.. code:: bash

    python3 setup.py --command-packages=click_man.commands man_pages

â†’ Checkout the `debian packaging
example <https://github.com/timofurrer/click-man#debian-packages>`__

What it does
------------

*click-man* will generate one man page per command of your click CLI
application specified in ``console_scripts`` in your ``setup.py``.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install click-man

**click-man** is also available for Python 2:

.. code:: bash

    pip install click-man

Usage Recipes
-------------

The following sections describe different usage example for *click-man*.

Use with setuptools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**click-man** provides a sane setuptools command extension which can be
used like the following:

.. code:: bash

    python3 setup.py --command-packages=click_man.commands man_pages

or specify the man pages target directory:

.. code:: bash

    python3 setup.py --command-packages=click_man.commands man_pages --target path/to/man/pages

Automatic man page installation with setuptools and pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This approach of installing man pages is problematic for various
reasons:

(1) Man pages are a UNIX thing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python in general and with that pip and setuptools are aimed to be
platform independent. Man pages are **not**: they are a UNIX thing which
means setuptools does not provide a sane solution to generate and
install man pages. We should consider using automatic man page
installation only with vendor specific packaging, e.g. for ``*.deb`` or
``*.rpm`` packages.

(2) We want to generate man pages on the fly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, we do not want to commit man pages to our source control. We want
to generate them on the fly. Either during build or installation time.

With setuptools and pip we face two problems:

1. If we generate and install them during installation of the package
   pip does not know about the man pages and thus cannot uninstall it.
2. If we generate them in our build process and add them to your
   distribution we do not have a way to prevent installation to
   */usr/share/man* for non-UNIX-like Operating Systems.

Debian packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``debhelper`` packages provides a very convenient script called
``dh_installman``. It checks for the ``debian/(pkg_name.)manpages`` file
and it's content which is basically a line by line list of man pages or
globs:

::

    debian/tmp/manpages/*

We override the rule provided by ``dh_installman`` to generate our man
pages in advance, like this:

.. code:: makefile

    override_dh_installman:
        python3 setup.py --command-packages=click_man.commands man_pages --target debian/tmp/manpages
        dh_installman -O--buildsystem=pybuild

Now we are able to build are debian package with the tool of your
choice, e.g.:

``debuild -us -uc``

Checkout a working example here: `repo debian
package <https://github.com/timofurrer/click-man/tree/master/examples/debian_pkg>`__
