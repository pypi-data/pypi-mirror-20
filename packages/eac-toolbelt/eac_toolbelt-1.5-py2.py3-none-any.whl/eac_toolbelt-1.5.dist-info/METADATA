This repository provides the source code to the `toolbelt` tool, which is a command line client
written in Python that is used to administer systems administration tasks through a variety
of utilities that have been combined together into a single tool.

*Note: the initial components of this tool previously made up the `replicator`, `geocoder`, `shapeloader` and `load-gnaf` services*

### Overview

Run with `toolbelt` after install (it should be in your path)

Available commands:

* `loadshapes` - load directories of shapefiles into Postgresql with specific support for PSMA distributions (selecting subsets of data, based on bbox or states)
* `loadgnaf` - loads a normalized version of GNAF into Postgresql using the PSV format or a raw dump
* `initdb` - initializes a database from SQL scripts (for use with `db-schema`)
* `initsearch` - intializes and builds indexes for Elastic Search based on a defined schema

### Quickstart Install

This project is distributed on PyPi - the Python package management environment. It can be installed across all
platforms easily and usually with a single command (provided you don't require editing the source code)

*Note: this tool will soon be provided as a standalone binary and installer for all platforms using the PyInstaller library*

1. Setup on Mac OS X

Start with Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew install python
$ easy_install toolbelt
```

*Note: This will install toolbelt globally, the better option would be to install it into its own environment using `virtualenv`

2. Setup with Windows

Install [python for Windows](http://www.python.org/download/)

Open a command prompt and run `easy_install toolbelt`
