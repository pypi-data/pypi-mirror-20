Description: concatPDF
        =========
        
        |Build Status|
        
        Simply concat PDF files based on their file names and configuration
        file.
        
        The order is first based on the globbing in the config.ini file and
        second on the numerical order of the file names.
        
        File names not starting with a number are ignored.
        
        Valid names are:
        
        -  1.0\_my\_nr\_1pdf.pdf
        -  4.pdf
        -  3.13\_the\_third.PDF
        -  1.1-i-will-be-second.pdf
        
        Concatenation order
        -------------------
        
        Leading in determining the concatenation order is the ``config.ini``
        file.
        
        Example config.ini
        
        ::
        
                [DIR]
                build = ./build
                source = ./source
        
                [ORDER]
                1 = 1*
                2 = appendix/*
                3 = *
        
                [OUTPUT]
                filename = output
        
        1. The configuration file above will first concatenate all pdf files
           matching the '1' glob in the ``source/`` directory.
        2. Secondly all files in the ``source/appendix/`` directory are appended
           to the pdf.
        3. And finally the remaining files in the ``source/`` directory are
           added.
        
        Note that only pdf files will be added. So ``*`` can be safely used.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``$ pip install git+https://github.com/ritchie46/concatPDF.git``
        
        Initialise a project
        --------------------
        
        Go to you project directory and run:
        
        ``$ concatPDF``
        
        To start the build run ``make.py`` from your projects root directory.
