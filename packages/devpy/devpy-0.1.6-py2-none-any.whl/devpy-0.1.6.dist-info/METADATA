DEVPY
-----

Devpy is a set of tools to ease Python development.

Install
=========

::

    pip install devpy


Autolog
========

Setuping proper loging is tedious, so you may want to do it later, but you wish you could get basic logging right now::

    import devpy

    # Get a logger that automatically log to console and a rotating file
    # The rotating file is setup in the temp directory of your system, in
    # a subdir named after your script name.
    # Logs are colored in the console according their level.
    # The file path is printed at the begining of the program.

    log = devpy.autolog() # log is a regular stdlib logger object

    # start logging:

    log.info('Yes')

Once you have time to setup logging seriously, you can just replace the autolog with a regular custom Python logger, and all your logs will still work.

Setting the environment variable DEVPY_LOG_LEVEL to an integer or a level name (debug, info, error, warning, critical...) will set the autolog log to it.

Setting the environment variable DEVPY_COLOR_LOG to 0 disable the color in the log.


Stacktrace helper
=================

Format the stack trace so that:

- it separates the various logicial blocs
- it emphasis the lines of your program and not the stdlb
- lines of your program are syntax highlighted

Just do::

    import devpy
    devpy.color_traceback()


All helpers at once
===================

Two ways::

    import devpy
    log = devpy.dev_mode()  # can set color_traceback=True, autolog=True

    # or just
    # import devpy.develop as log
    # for a one liner to activate it all
