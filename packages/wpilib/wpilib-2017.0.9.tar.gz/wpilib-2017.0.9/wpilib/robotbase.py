    The RobotBase class is intended to be subclassed by a user creating a
    robot program.  Overridden ``autonomous()`` and ``operatorControl()`` methods
    are called at the appropriate time as the match proceeds. In the current
    implementation, the Autonomous code will run to completion before the
    OperatorControl code could start. In the future the Autonomous code might
    be spawned as a task, then killed at the end of the Autonomous period.
    
    User code should be placed in the constructor that runs before the
    Autonomous or Operator Control period starts. The constructor will
    run to completion before Autonomous is entered.

    .. warning:: If you override ``__init__`` in your robot class, you must call
                 the base class constructor. This must be used to ensure that
                 the communications code starts.
