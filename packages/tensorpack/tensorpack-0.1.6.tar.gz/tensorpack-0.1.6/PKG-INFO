        Tutorials are not fully finished. See some `examples <examples>`__ to
        learn about the framework:
        
        Vision:
        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  `DoReFa-Net: train binary / low-bitwidth CNN on
           ImageNet <examples/DoReFa-Net>`__
        -  `Train ResNet on ImageNet / Cifar10 / SVHN <examples/ResNet>`__
        -  `InceptionV3 on ImageNet <examples/Inception/inceptionv3.py>`__
        -  `Fully-convolutional Network for Holistically-Nested Edge
           Detection(HED) <examples/HED>`__

        -  `Deep Q-Network(DQN) variants on Atari
           games <examples/DeepQNetwork>`__
        -  `Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic(A3C) with demos on OpenAI
           Gym <examples/A3C-Gym>`__
        
        Unsupervised Learning:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  `Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) variants <examples/GAN>`__,
           including DCGAN, InfoGAN, Conditional GAN, WGAN, Image to Image.
        
        Speech / NLP:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  `LSTM-CTC for speech recognition <examples/CTC-TIMIT>`__
        -  `char-rnn for fun <examples/Char-RNN>`__
        -  `LSTM language model on PennTreebank <examples/PennTreebank>`__
        
        The examples are not only for demonstration of the framework -- you can
        train them and reproduce the results in papers.
        
        Features:
        ---------
        
        Describe your training task with three components:
        
        1. **Model**, or graph. ``models/`` has some scoped abstraction of
           common models, but you can simply use any symbolic functions
           available in tensorflow, or most functions in
           slim/tflearn/tensorlayer. ``LinearWrap`` and ``argscope`` simplify
           large models (`vgg
           example <https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/blob/master/examples/load-vgg16.py>`__).
        
        2. **DataFlow**. tensorpack allows and encourages complex data
           processing.
        
           -  All data producer has an unified interface, allowing them to be
              composed to perform complex preprocessing.
           -  Use Python to easily handle any data format, yet still keep good
              performance thanks to multiprocess prefetch & TF Queue prefetch.
              For example, InceptionV3 can run in the same speed as the official
              code which reads data by TF operators.
        
        3. **Callbacks**, including everything you want to do apart from the
           training iterations, such as:
        
           -  Change hyperparameters during training
           -  Print some tensors of interest
           -  Run inference on a test dataset
           -  Run some operations once a while
           -  Send loss to your phone
        
        With the above components defined, tensorpack trainer will run the
        training iterations for you. Multi-GPU training is off-the-shelf by
        simply switching the trainer. You can also define your own trainer for
        non-standard training (e.g. GAN).
