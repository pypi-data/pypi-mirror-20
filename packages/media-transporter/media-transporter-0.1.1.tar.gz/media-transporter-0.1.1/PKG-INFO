        media-transporter is a project that arose out of laziness and boredom,
        mainly. There are plenty of similar or fully-featured alternatives like
        SickBeard and others, but I already had an existing workflow for:
        
        -  Polling RSS feeds and downloading torrent files
           (`Otomatic <http://codingcurious.com/otomatic>`__).
        -  Automatic watching of a folder for torrents and auto-adding to a
           torrent client (`Transmission <https://transmissionbt.com>`__).
        
        The last piece involved the need to move completed downloads to my NAS.
        Enter ``media-transporter``. Here's how it works:
        
        -  Create ``config.py`` in the same directory as ``transport.py``. Use
           ``config_example.py`` as a template. The main options are
           ``media_shares``, ``download_path``, and ``unrar_path``. Adjust these
           to match the path to your media share, where you have finished
           downloads, and the **absolute** path to the ``unrar`` binary. The
           ``share_[tv|movie]_*`` config options point to the path on your media
           share where TV and Movies are stored.
        -  When executed (preferably automatically after a torrent is completed
           (Transmission is built to support this, for example)),
           ``media-transporter`` determines if your configured media share is
           within an acceptable range for storage capacity (configured in
           ``config.py``).
        -  If it is, ``media-transporter`` checks your Downloads folder for
           media files and folders, and intelligently moves each of them to
           their appropriate destination on your media share.
        -  Logs are written to the value of ``log file`` to record all actions
           taken during processing. Useful for debugging.
        
        The idea is that ``media-transporter`` will be able to be used on
        multiple platforms, including Windows. At the moment,
        ``media-transporter`` has only been tested on OS X and Linux, but it
        should be feasible to support Windows very easily.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Python 2.\*
        -  ``unrar`` via either apt-get/yum (Linux), homebrew (OS X), WinRAR
           (Windows)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ pip install transporter
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Things to do
        ------------
        
        -  Code cleanup. Plenty of stuff to do. This wasn't originally meant for
           public distribution.
        -  Support and test script on Windows.
