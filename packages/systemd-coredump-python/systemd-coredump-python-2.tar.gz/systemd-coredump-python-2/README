LICENSE:
    GPLv2.1+ for all code

REQUIREMENTS:
    Python 2.x or 3.x.
    Tested with CPython, PyPy, PyPy3.

    (Does not work with Jython: 2.5 is too old, and 2.7 is broken,
    see http://bugs.jython.org/issue2405.)

    systemd v. 233 or later is required.

USAGE:

    For this module provides a function which may be installed as the
    `sys.excepthook` exception handler. It will generate a backtrace
    and invoke systemd-coredump(8) to send it to off to the journal
    along with some additional metadata about the python process.

    When installed, a .pth file is also installed which loads this
    module and checks if it should handle `sys.excepthook`. It will be
    automatically enabled if /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern specifies
    systemd-coredump.

    It is also possible to unconditionally install this module as
    `sys.excepthook` by calling
    `systemd_coredump_exception_handler.install(True)`.
