pyinfra
=======

|PyPI version| |Travis.CI status|

pyinfra automates service deployment. It does this by diff-ing the state
of the server with the state defined in the deploy script. Deploys are
asyncronous and highly performant. The inventory & deploy are managed
with pure Python, allowing for near-infinite extendability.

Design Features
---------------

pyinfra was designed from day one to enable ops to deploy things in a
consistent, debuggable and maintainable manner. Notable design
decisions:

-  outputs shell commands and files to upload
-  two-step deploy that enables dry-runs
-  fail fast where possible (eg touching a directory)
-  ``-v`` means print out remote stdout & stderr in realtime
-  always print raw stderr on operation failure for *instant* debugging
-  uses pure, 100% Python for the inventory and deploy scripts

   -  with operations/hooks to safely use Python mid-deploy

-  properly agentless - even Python isn't required on the remote side
   (just a shell!)

Development
-----------

pyinfra is still under heavy development, and while the CLI/API should
be considered fairly stable there's no guarantee of no breaking changes
until ``v1``. There are a number of critical specifications to be
properly fleshed out before the ``v1`` release:

-  spec/docs for roles/sub-deploys
-  spec/docs for extension modules/facts
-  spec/docs for extension deploys

To develop pyinfra itself:

.. code:: sh

    # Create a virtualenv
    venv create pyinfra

    # Install pyinfra in dev mode, with dev requirements
    pip install -e .[dev]

Use ``nosetests`` or the bundled helper script to run tests. This helper
script also counts coverage:

.. code:: sh

    # Test everything (API, modules & facts)
    scripts/test.sh

    # Set individual bits
    scripts/test.sh [api|modules|facts]
