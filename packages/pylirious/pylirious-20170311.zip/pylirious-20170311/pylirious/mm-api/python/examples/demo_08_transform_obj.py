# [RMS] transformation & boolean demo. Shows how to:
#   - import a mesh file and identify new objects
#   - get spatial information about the current selection, ie position & sfc normal
#   - Transform a mesh to be aligned with a 3D position/normal
#   - do a boolean operation
#  !!! Requires an initial Face Selection. The imported part will be
#      positioned at/near the center of the selected region
