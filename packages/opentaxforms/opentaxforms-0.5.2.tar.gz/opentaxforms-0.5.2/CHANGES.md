- main: fix log.name in indicateProgress [still refers to the previous form].

- linting via landscape.io, including shortening long lines, removing unused variables, and refactoring some long functions.
- fixed all broken doctests.
- both cross-module globals, log and cfg, are now importable.

0.4.15 (2017-01-09)

- bugfix: the ignoreCaches option now works.
- bugfix: skip forms setup if dirName is None.
- bugfix: ut.exists now insensitive to trailing slash.
- test: moved from relative to absolute paths so eg py.test works from outside of test/ dir.
- test: reorganize test/ dir: test_* subdirs are disposable, test-* arent.
- test/test_opentaxforms.py: command line options changed and expanded.
- test/test_opentaxforms.py: refactor TestOtfSteps, add test_run_1040_xfa, and finally add a script test to the [pytest] automated tests.

- add test/README.md as guide to the test/ directory.
- probe access to phantomjs,casperjs in .travis.yml, hopefully for future integration of html5 tests.
- opentaxforms.py: in main, move form-summarizing code to try-else block.
- cache results of Form.pdfInfo for faster test run.
- add internal option to computeOverlap [for layout boxes; currently done inefficiently, thus costly].
- update 1040 target output file to fix broken test.
- cleanup opentaxforms.py/main.

0.4.14 (2016-12-31)

- mv math.py cmds.py: workaround for tox build failure [tox.Random imports py.math and gets our math.py instead].
- oops apparently gotta incl README for travis build to succeed.
- setup.cfg: git flow release already tags the release, so we dont want bumpversion to do so, otherwise git flow refuses to release.
