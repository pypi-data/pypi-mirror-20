        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Library for storing and exposing various metrics
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            pip install expvar
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        In the ``expvar.stats`` package there is a Stats class that can be
        instantiated as well as a global ``stats`` object that has already been
        instantiated. For most use cases the global stats object will be
        sufficient within an application.
