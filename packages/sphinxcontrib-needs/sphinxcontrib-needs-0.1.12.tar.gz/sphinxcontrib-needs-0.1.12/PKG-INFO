Description: This package contains the needs Sphinx extension.
        
        It allows the definition, linking and filtering of need-objects, which are by default:
        
        * requirements
        * specifications
        * implementations
        * test cases.
        
        This list can be easily customized via configuration (for instance to support bugs or user stories).
        
        .. code-block:: rst
        
            .. req:: My first requirement
               :status: open
               :tags: requirement; test; awesome
        
               This is my **first** requirement!!
               .. note:: It's awesome :)
        
            .. spec:: Specification of a requirement
               :id: OWN_ID_123
        
            .. impl:: Implementation for specification
               :id: impl_01
               :links: OWN_ID_123
        
            .. test:: Test for XY
               :status: implemented
               :tags: test; user_interface; python27
               :links: OWN_ID_123; impl_01
        
               This test checks the implementation of :ref:`impl_01` for spec :ref:`OWN_ID_123` inside a
               Python 2.7 environment.
        
        Each need can contain:
        
        * a title (required)
        * an unique id (optional. Gets calculated based on title if not given)
        * a description, which supports fully rst and sphinx extensions (optional)
        * a status (optional)
        * several tags (optional)
        * several links to other needs (optional)
        
        You can create filterable overviews of defined needs by using the needfilter directive::
        
            .. needfiler::
               :status: open;in_progress
               :tags: tests; test; test_case;
               :layout: table
        
        .. contents::
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using pip
        ---------
        ::
        
            pip install sphinxcontrib-needs
        
        Using sources
        -------------
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/useblocks/sphinxcontrib-needs
            python setup.py install
        
        conf.py
        =======
        
        Activation
        ----------
        
        Add **sphinxcontrib.needs** to your extensions::
        
            extensions = ["sphinxcontrib.needs",]
        
        Options
        -------
        
        All options starts with the prefix **needs_** for this extension.
        
        needs_include_needs
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Set this option on False, if no needs should be documented inside the generated documentation.
        
        Default: **True**::
        
            needs_include_needs = False
        
        needs_id_length
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This option defines the length of an automated generated ID (the length of the prefix does not count).
        
        Default: **5**::
        
            needs_id_length = 3
        
        .. _need_types:
        
        needs_types
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The option allows the setup of own need types like bugs, user_stories and more.
        
        By default it is set to::
        
            needs_types = [dict(directive="req", title="Requirement", prefix="R_"),
                       dict(directive="spec", title="Specification", prefix="S_"),
                       dict(directive="impl", title="Implementation", prefix="I_"),
                       dict(directive="test", title="Test Case", prefix="T_"),
                       ]
        
        needs_types must be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary **must** contain the following items:
        
        * **directive**: Name of the directive. For instance "req", which can be used via `.. req::` in documents
        * **title** Title, which is used as human readable name in lists
        * **prefix** A prefix for generated IDs, to easily identify that an ID belongs to a specific type. Can Also be ""
        
        needs_template
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The layout of needs can be fully customized by using `jinja <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_.
        
        If nothing is set, the following default template is used::
        
            .. _{{id}}:
        
            {% if hide == false -%}
            {{type_name}}: **{{title}}** ({{id}})
        
                {{content|indent(4) }}
        
                {% if status and not hide_status -%}
                **status**: {{status}}
                {% endif %}
        
                {% if tags and not hide_tags -%}
                **tags**: {{"; ".join(tags)}}
                {% endif %}
        
                {% if links -%}
                **links**:
                {% for link in links -%}
                    :ref:`{{link}} <{{link}}>` {%if loop.index < links|length -%}; {% endif -%}
                {% endfor -%}
                {% endif -%}
            {% endif -%}
        
        Available jinja variables are:
        
        * type
        * type_name
        * type_prefix
        * status
        * tags
        * id
        * links
        * title
        * content
        * hide
        * hide_tags
        * hide_status
        
        .. warning::
        
           You must add reference like `.. _{{id}}:` to the templates. Otherwise linking will not work!
        
        
        Directives
        ==========
        
        req (or any other defined need type)
        ------------------------------------
        
        Example::
        
            .. req:: User needs to login
               :id: ID123
               :status: open
               :tags: user;login
               :links: ID444; ID_555
        
               Our users needs to get logged in via our login forms on **/login.php**.
        
        This creates a new requirement, with a title, content, given id, a status and several tags.
        
        All options are optional, only the title as argument must be given.
        
        However, if no **id** is given, a short hash value is calculated based on the title. If the title gets not changed, the
        id will be stable for all upcoming documentation generations.
        
        **Tags** must be separated by "**;**", like tag1; tag2;tag3. Whitespaces get removed.
        
        **links** can be used to create a link to one or several other needs, no matter what kind of type they are.
        All you need is the related ID.
        
        There is an additional option **:hide:**, if this is set (no value is needed), the need will not be printed in
        documentation. But it will show up in need filters!
        
        You can also use **:hide_status:** and **:hide_tags:** ti hide the related information for this need.
        
        .. note::
        
            By default the above example works also with `.. spec::`, `.. impl::`, `.. test::` and all other need types,
            which are configured via **needs_types**.
        
        needfilter
        ----------
        
        Example::
        
            .. needfilter::
               :status: open;in_progress
               :tags: user; login
               :show_status:
               :show_tags:
               :show_filters:
               :sort_by: id
               :layout: list
        
        This prints a list with all found needs, which match the filters for status and tags.
        
        For **:status:** and **:tags:** values are separated by "**;**". The logic is as followed::
        
            status = (open OR in_progress) AND tags = (user OR login)
        
        If **:show_status:** / **:show_tags:** is given, the related information will be shown after the name of the need.
        
        To show the used filters under a list, set **:show_filters:**
        
        The showed list is unsorted as long as the parameter **:sort_by::** is not used.
        Valid options for **:sort_by:** are **id** and **status**.
        
        Instead of a list you can also get a table by setting `:layout: table`.
