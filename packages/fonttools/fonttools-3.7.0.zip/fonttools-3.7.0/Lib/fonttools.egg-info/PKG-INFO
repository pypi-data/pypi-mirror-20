        What is this?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        | fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
          project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
          fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
          supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
          Mac-specific formats. The project has a `BSD-style open-source
          licence <LICENSE>`__.
        | Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        FontTools requires `Python <http://www.python.org/download/>`__ 2.7, 3.4
        or later.
        
        The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
        install it with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`__:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip install fonttools
        
        If you would like to contribute to its development, you can clone the
        repository from Github, install the package in 'editable' mode and
        modify the source code in place. We recommend creating a virtual
        environment, using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__ or
        Python 3 `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ module.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            # download the source code to 'fonttools' folder
            git clone https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools.git
            cd fonttools
        
            # create new virtual environment called e.g. 'fonttools-venv', or anything you like
            python -m virtualenv fonttools-venv
        
            # source the `activate` shell script to enter the environment (Un\*x); to exit, just type `deactivate`
            . fonttools-venv/bin/activate
        
            # to activate the virtual environment in Windows `cmd.exe`, do
            fonttools-venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        
            # install in 'editable' mode
            pip install -e .
        
        TTX – From OpenType and TrueType to XML and Back
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Once installed you can use the ``ttx`` command to convert binary font
        files (``.otf``, ``.ttf``, etc) to the TTX xml format, edit them, and
        convert them back to binary format. TTX files have a .ttx file
        extension.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            ttx /path/to/font.otf
            ttx /path/to/font.ttx
        
        The TTX application works can be used in two ways, depending on what
        platform you run it on:
        
        -  As a command line tool (Windows/DOS, Unix, MacOSX)
        -  By dropping files onto the application (Windows, MacOS)
        
        TTX detects what kind of files it is fed: it will output a ``.ttx`` file
        when it sees a ``.ttf`` or ``.otf``, and it will compile a ``.ttf`` or
        ``.otf`` when the input file is a ``.ttx`` file. By default, the output
        file is created in the same folder as the input file, and will have the
        same name as the input file but with a different extension. TTX will
        *never* overwrite existing files, but if necessary will append a unique
        number to the output filename (before the extension) such as
        ``Arial#1.ttf``
        
        When using TTX from the command line there are a bunch of extra options,
        these are explained in the help text, as displayed when typing
        ``ttx -h`` at the command prompt. These additional options include:
        
        -  specifying the folder where the output files are created
        -  specifying which tables to dump or which tables to exclude
        -  merging partial ``.ttx`` files with existing ``.ttf`` or ``.otf``
           files
        -  listing brief table info instead of dumping to ``.ttx``
        -  splitting tables to separate ``.ttx`` files
        -  disabling TrueType instruction disassembly
        
        The TTX file format
        -------------------
        
        The following tables are currently supported:
        
        .. begin table list
        .. code::
        
            BASE, CBDT, CBLC, CFF, COLR, CPAL, DSIG, EBDT, EBLC, FFTM, GDEF,
            GMAP, GPKG, GPOS, GSUB, HVAR, JSTF, LTSH, MATH, META, MVAR, OS/2,
            SING, STAT, SVG, TSI0, TSI1, TSI2, TSI3, TSI5, TSIB, TSID, TSIJ,
            TSIP, TSIS, TSIV, VDMX, VORG, VVAR, avar, cmap, cvar, cvt, feat,
            fpgm, fvar, gasp, glyf, gvar, hdmx, head, hhea, hmtx, kern, loca,
            ltag, maxp, meta, name, post, prep, sbix, trak, vhea and vmtx
        .. end table list
        
        Other tables are dumped as hexadecimal data.
        
        TrueType fonts use glyph indices (GlyphIDs) to refer to glyphs in most
        places. While this is fine in binary form, it is really hard to work
        with for humans. Therefore we use names instead.
        
        The glyph names are either extracted from the ``CFF`` table or the
        ``post`` table, or are derived from a Unicode ``cmap`` table. In the
        latter case the Adobe Glyph List is used to calculate names based on
        Unicode values. If all of these methods fail, names are invented based
        on GlyphID (eg ``glyph00142``)
        
        It is possible that different glyphs use the same name. If this happens,
        we force the names to be unique by appending ``#n`` to the name (``n``
        being an integer number.) The original names are being kept, so this has
        no influence on a "round tripped" font.
        
        Because the order in which glyphs are stored inside the binary font is
        important, we maintain an ordered list of glyph names in the font.
        
        Other Tools
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Commands for inspecting, merging and subsetting fonts are also
        available:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pyftinspect
            pyftmerge
            pyftsubset
        
        fontTools Python Module
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The fontTools python module provides a convenient way to
        programmatically edit font files.
        
        .. code:: py
        
            >>> from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont
            >>> font = TTFont('/path/to/font.ttf')
            >>> font
            <fontTools.ttLib.TTFont object at 0x10c34ed50>
            >>>
        
        A selection of sample python programs is in the
        `Snippets <https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/blob/master/Snippets/>`__
        directory.
        
        Testing
        ~~~~~~~
        
        To run the test suite, you can do:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            python setup.py test
        
        If you have `pytest <http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__, you can run
        the ``pytest`` command directly. The tests will run against the
        installed ``fontTools`` package, or the first one found in the
        ``PYTHONPATH``.
        
        You can also use `tox <https://testrun.org/tox/latest/>`__ to
        automatically run tests on different Python versions in isolated virtual
        environments.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip install tox
            tox
        
        Note that when you run ``tox`` without arguments, the tests are executed
        for all the environments listed in tox.ini's ``envlist``. In our case,
        this includes Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6, so for this to work the
        ``python2.7``, ``python3.5`` and ``python3.6`` executables must be
        available in your ``PATH``.
        
        You can specify an alternative environment list via the ``-e`` option,
        or the ``TOXENV`` environment variable:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            tox -e py27-nocov
            TOXENV="py{27,36}-cov" tox
        
        Development Community
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        TTX/FontTools development is ongoing in an active community of
        developers, that includes professional developers employed at major
        software corporations and type foundries as well as hobbyists.
        
        Feature requests and bug reports are always welcome at
        https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/
        
        The best place for discussions about TTX from an end-user perspective as
        well as TTX/FontTools development is the
        https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fonttools mailing list. There is also
        a development https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fonttools-dev mailing

        History
        ~~~~~~~
        
        The fontTools project was started by Just van Rossum in 1999, and was
        maintained as an open source project at
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/. In 2008, Paul Wise (pabs3)
        began helping Just with stability maintenance. In 2013 Behdad Esfahbod
        began a friendly fork, thoroughly reviewing the codebase and making
        changes at https://github.com/behdad/fonttools to add new features and
        support for new font formats.

        3.2.1 (released 2016-11-03)
        ---------------------------
        
        -  [OS/2] fix checking ``fsSelection`` bits matching ``head.macStyle``
           bits
        -  [varLib] added ``--build-HVAR`` option to generate ``HVAR`` table for
           fonts with TrueType outlines. For ``CFF2``, it is enabled by default.
        
        3.2.0 (released 2016-11-02)
        ---------------------------
        
        -  [varLib] Improve support for OpenType 1.8 Variable Fonts:
        -  Implement GDEF's VariationStore
        -  Implement HVAR/VVAR tables
        -  Partial support for loading MutatorMath .designspace files with
           varLib.designspace module
        -  Add varLib.models with Variation fonts interpolation models
        -  Implement GSUB/GPOS FeatureVariations
        -  Initial support for interpolating and merging OpenType Layout tables
           (see ``varLib.interpolate_layout`` and ``varLib.merger`` modules)
        -  [API change] Change version to be an integer instead of a float in
           XML output for GSUB, GPOS, GDEF, MATH, BASE, JSTF, HVAR, VVAR, feat,
           hhea and vhea tables. Scripts that set the Version for those to 1.0
           or other float values also need fixing. A warning is emitted when
           code or XML needs fix.
        -  several bug fixes to the cffLib module, contributed by Adobe's
           @readroberts
        -  The XML output for CFF table now has a 'major' and 'minor' elements
           for specifying whether it's version 1.0 or 2.0 (support for CFF2 is
           coming soon)
        -  [setup.py] remove undocumented/deprecated ``extra_path`` Distutils
           argument. This means that we no longer create a "FontTools" subfolder
           in site-packages containing the actual fontTools package, as well as
           the standalone xmlWriter and sstruct modules. The latter modules are
           also deprecated, and scheduled for removal in upcoming releases.
           Please change your import statements to point to from fontTools.misc
           import xmlWriter and from fontTools.misc import sstruct.
        -  [scripts] Add a 'fonttools' command-line tool that simply runs
           ``fontTools.*`` sub-modules: e.g. ``fonttools ttx``,
           ``fonttools subset``, etc.
        -  [hmtx/vmts] Read advance width/heights as unsigned short (uint16);
           automatically round float values to integers.
        -  [ttLib/xmlWriter] add 'newlinestr=None' keyword argument to
           ``TTFont.saveXML`` for overriding os-specific line endings (passed on
           to ``XMLWriter`` instances).
        -  [versioning] Use versioneer instead of ``setuptools_scm`` to
           dynamically load version info from a git checkout at import time.
        -  [feaLib] Support backslash-prefixed glyph names.
        
        3.1.2 (released 2016-09-27)

           fonts tables, and 'gvar' table for variation fonts.
        -  [Snippets] Add ``symfont.py``, for symbolic font statistics analysis;
           interpolatable.py, a preliminary script for detecting interpolation
           errors; ``{merge,dump}_woff_metadata.py``.
        -  [classifyTools] Helpers to classify things into classes.
        -  [CI] Run tests on Windows, Linux and macOS using Appveyor and Travis
           CI; check unit test coverage with Coverage.py/Coveralls; automatic
           deployment to PyPI on tags.
        -  [loggingTools] Use Python built-in logging module to print messages.
        -  [py23] Make round() behave like Python 3 built-in round(); define
           round2() and round3().

        2.3 (released 2009-11-08)
        -------------------------
        
        -  TrueType Collection (TTC) support
        -  Python 2.6 support
        -  Update Unicode data to 5.2.0
        -  Couple of bug fixes
        
        2.2 (released 2008-05-18)
        -------------------------
        
        -  ClearType support
        -  cmap format 1 support
        -  PFA font support
        -  Switched from Numeric to numpy
        -  Update Unicode data to 5.1.0
        -  Update AGLFN data to 1.6
        -  Many bug fixes
        
        2.1 (released 2008-01-28)
        -------------------------
        
        -  Many years worth of fixes and features
        
        2.0b2 (released 2002-??-??)
        ---------------------------
        
        -  Be "forgiving" when interpreting the maxp table version field:
           interpret any value as 1.0 if it's not 0.5. Fixes dumping of these
           GPL fonts: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/pds.cgi?ports/chinese/wangttf
        -  Fixed ttx -l: it turned out this part of the code didn't work with
           Python 2.2.1 and earlier. My bad to do most of my testing with a
           different version than I shipped TTX with :-(
        -  Fixed bug in ClassDef format 1 subtable (Andreas Seidel bumped into
           this one).
        
        2.0b1 (released 2002-09-10)
        ---------------------------
        
        -  Fixed embarrassing bug: the master checksum in the head table is now
           calculated correctly even on little-endian platforms (such as Intel).
        -  Made the cmap format 4 compiler smarter: the binary data it creates
           is now more or less as compact as possible. TTX now makes more
           compact data than in any shipping font I've tested it with.
        -  Dump glyph names as a separate "GlyphOrder" pseudo table as opposed
           to as part of the glyf table (obviously needed for CFF-OTF's).
        -  Added proper support for the CFF table.
        -  Don't barf on empty tables (questionable, but "there are font out
           there...")
        -  When writing TT glyf data, align glyphs on 4-byte boundaries. This
           seems to be the current recommendation by MS. Also: don't barf on
           fonts which are already 4-byte aligned.
        -  Windows installer contributed bu Adam Twardoch! Yay!
        -  Changed the command line interface again, now by creating one new
           tool replacing the old ones: ttx It dumps and compiles, depending on
           input file types. The options have changed somewhat.
        -  The -d option is back (output dir)
        -  ttcompile's -i options is now called -m (as in "merge"), to avoid
           clash with dump's -i.
        -  The -s option ("split tables") no longer creates a directory, but
           instead outputs a small .ttx file containing references to the
           individual table files. This is not a true link, it's a simple file
           name, and the referenced file should be in the same directory so
           ttcompile can find them.
        -  compile no longer accepts a directory as input argument. Instead it
           can parse the new "mini-ttx" format as output by "ttx -s".
        -  all arguments are input files
        -  Renamed the command line programs and moved them to the Tools
           subdirectory. They are now installed by the setup.py install script.
        -  Added OpenType support. BASE, GDEF, GPOS, GSUB and JSTF are (almost)
           fully supported. The XML output is not yet final, as I'm still
           considering to output certain subtables in a more human-friendly
           manner.
        -  Fixed 'kern' table to correctly accept subtables it doesn't know
           about, as well as interpreting Apple's definition of the 'kern' table
           headers correctly.
        -  Fixed bug where glyphnames were not calculated from 'cmap' if it was
           (one of the) first tables to be decompiled. More specifically: it
           cmap was the first to ask for a glyphID -> glyphName mapping.
        -  Switched XML parsers: use expat instead of xmlproc. Should be faster.
        -  Removed my UnicodeString object: I now require Python 2.0 or up,
           which has unicode support built in.
        -  Removed assert in glyf table: redundant data at the end of the table
           is now ignored instead of raising an error. Should become a warning.
        -  Fixed bug in hmtx/vmtx code that only occured if all advances were
           equal.
        -  Fixed subtle bug in TT instruction disassembler.
        -  Couple of fixes to the 'post' table.
        -  Updated OS/2 table to latest spec.
        
        1.0b1 (released 2001-08-10)
        ---------------------------
        
        -  Reorganized the command line interface for ttDump.py and
           ttCompile.py, they now behave more like "normal" command line tool,
           in that they accept multiple input files for batch processing.
        -  ttDump.py and ttCompile.py don't silently override files anymore, but
           ask before doing so. Can be overridden by -f.
        -  Added -d option to both ttDump.py and ttCompile.py.
        -  Installation is now done with distutils. (Needs work for environments
           without compilers.)
        -  Updated installation instructions.
        -  Added some workarounds so as to handle certain buggy fonts more
           gracefully.
        -  Updated Unicode table to Unicode 3.0 (Thanks Antoine!)
        -  Included a Python script by Adam Twardoch that adds some useful stuff
           to the Windows registry.
        -  Moved the project to SourceForge.
        
        1.0a6 (released 2000-03-15)
        ---------------------------
        
        -  Big reorganization: made ttLib a subpackage of the new fontTools
           package, changed several module names. Called the entire suite
           "FontTools"
        -  Added several submodules to fontTools, some new, some older.
        -  Added experimental CFF/GPOS/GSUB support to ttLib, read-only (but XML
           dumping of GPOS/GSUB is for now disabled)
        -  Fixed hdmx endian bug
        -  Added -b option to ttCompile.py, it disables recalculation of
           bounding boxes, as requested by Werner Lemberg.
        -  Renamed tt2xml.pt to ttDump.py and xml2tt.py to ttCompile.py
        -  Use ".ttx" as file extension instead of ".xml".
        -  TTX is now the name of the XML-based *format* for TT fonts, and not
           just an application.
        
        1.0a5
        -----
        
        Never released
        
        -  More tables supported: hdmx, vhea, vmtx
        
        1.0a3 & 1.0a4
        -------------
        
        Never released
        
        -  fixed most portability issues
        -  retracted the "Euro_or_currency" change from 1.0a2: it was
           nonsense!
        
        1.0a2 (released 1999-05-02)
        ---------------------------
        
        -  binary release for MacOS
        -  genenates full FOND resources: including width table, PS font name
           info and kern table if applicable.
        -  added cmap format 4 support. Extra: dumps Unicode char names as XML
           comments!
        -  added cmap format 6 support
        -  now accepts true type files starting with "true" (instead of just
           0x00010000 and "OTTO")
        -  'glyf' table support is now complete: I added support for composite
           scale, xy-scale and two-by-two for the 'glyf' table. For now,
           component offset scale behaviour defaults to Apple-style. This only
           affects the (re)calculation of the glyph bounding box.
        -  changed "Euro" to "Euro_or_currency" in the Standard Apple Glyph
           order list, since we cannot tell from the 'post' table which is
           meant. I should probably doublecheck with a Unicode encoding if
           available. (This does not affect the output!)
        
        Fixed bugs: - 'hhea' table is now recalculated correctly - fixed wrong
        assumption about sfnt resource names
        
        1.0a1 (released 1999-04-27)
        ---------------------------
        
        -  initial binary release for MacOS
