**pynamical** is a Python package for modeling, simulating, visualizing, and animating discrete 
nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos. pynamical uses pandas, numpy, and numba for fast simulation, 
and matplotlib for beautiful visualizations and animations to explore system behavior. Compatible 
with Python 2 and 3. See the examples and demos on `GitHub`_.
