Welcome to Operalib's documentation!
====================================

Operalib is a library for structured learning and prediction for python based on
operator-valued kernels (OVKs). OVKs are an extension of scalar kernels to
operator-valued kernels. The idea is to predict silmultaneously several targets
while, for instance, encoding the output structure with the operator-valued
kernel.

We aim at providing an easy-to-use standard implementation of operator-valued
kernel methods. Operalib is designed for compatilibity to scikit-learn
interface and conventions. It uses numpy, and scipy as underlying libraries.

The project is developed by the AROBAS group of the IBISC laboratory of the
University of Evry, France.
