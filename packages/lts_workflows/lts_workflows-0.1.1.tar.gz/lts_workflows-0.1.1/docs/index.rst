lts-workflow documentation
==========================================

The lts-workflow module is a top-level module for workflow
repositories developed by the `SciLifeLab Bioinformatics Long-term
Support <https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/wabi/>`_ team.

Note that this module doesn't actually contain any workflows. Rather,
it provides helper functions and documentation of a more general
nature that relates to all workflows.
