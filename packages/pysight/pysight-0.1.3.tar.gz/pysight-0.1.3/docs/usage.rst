Usage
=====

To use PySight run::

    from pysight import main_multiscaler_readout


    main_multiscaler_readout.run()


This command will open a GUI in which you'll have to choose a ``.lst`` file to parse.

Results are saved in a ``.tif`` file with the same name as the original ``.lst`` file, in the same directory.
