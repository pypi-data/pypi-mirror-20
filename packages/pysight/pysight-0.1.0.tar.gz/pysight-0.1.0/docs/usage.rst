Usage
=====

To use PySight run::

    $ python main_multiscaler_readout

This command will open a GUI in which you'll have to choose a ``.lst`` file to parse. You can also open the script
itself and run it manually.

Results are saved in a ``.tif`` file with the same name as the original ``.lst`` file, in the same directory.
