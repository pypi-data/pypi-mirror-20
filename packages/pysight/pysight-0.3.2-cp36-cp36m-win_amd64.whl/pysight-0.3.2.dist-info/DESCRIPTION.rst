0.1.3 (2017-02-28)
------------------

* Changed IO from ``.read()`` to ``.readlines()`` for better Linux compatibility.

* ``.tif`` is now saved frame-by-frame to save memory, and the method was renamed to ``create_tif()``.

0.1.4 (2017-02-28)
------------------

* Frames are now generated with a generator.
* Fix to installation problems of previous version.

0.1.5 (2017-02-28)

0.1.6 (2017-02-28)

* More tests coverage.

* Enforced a few types checks.

0.1.7 (2017-03-01)

* Start of TAG lens interpolation support.

0.2.0 (2017-03-05)
------------------

* Support for TAG lens added - phase interpolation and image display. Note: The algorithm currently assumes that the pulse is triggered at the zero-phase of the TAG lens.

* ``pip`` installation fixed by requiring Numba as a prerequisite.

* Number of pixels in the "Frame" direction (x) supersedes the number of frames as listed by the user.

* Due to massive changes, one test is currently broken.

0.3.0 (2017-03-07)
------------------

* Added method ``create_array`` to Movie() that returns a deque containing the raw data generated by the ``np.histogram`` function, for visualization and analysis purposes.

* Added method ``create_single_volume`` to Movie() that sums all stacks into a single array.

* Fixed bugs in ``tag_tools``, mainly in ``verify_periodicity()``.

* Allows for more elaborate user inputs, requiring to choose which type of output you wish for.

* Basic FLIM support.

0.3.1 (2017-03-07)
------------------

* Tiffs are now saved untiled. Depth axis is x-axis.

* Installation should run smoothly if following the instructions.

0.3.2 (2017-03-07)
------------------
* Added verifications on the FLIM input.

* Bug fixes in FLIM implementation.
