The author has used many time management programs over the last four years.
When the number of tasks grew, a neat system like Getting Things Done became essential.
Therefore the development of TreeNote was influenced by powerful tools like Omnifocus (Mac only) and Org mode (too complex).
However, TreeNote is as intuitive to use as the light tools Wunderlist and Evernote.

To run TreeNote simply type `treenote` in a Terminal.
