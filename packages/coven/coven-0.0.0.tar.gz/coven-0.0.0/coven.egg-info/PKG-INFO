        # Coven: Code Coverage Through Bytecode Witchcraft
        
        Coven is a test coverage harness for Python 3. It uses an extension to the CPython interpreter, pending integration (issue #24900) into Python 3.7. The patch also works on Python 3.6, and Coven is developed against 3.6.

        # Usage
        
        `coven` acts as a drop-in replacement for `python3`. Mileage may vary.
