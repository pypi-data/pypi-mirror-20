js.angular_xeditable
********************

Introduction
============

This library packages `Angular-xeditable`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Angular-xeditable`: https://vitalets.github.io/angular-xeditable/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.angular_xeditable``) are published to some URL.
