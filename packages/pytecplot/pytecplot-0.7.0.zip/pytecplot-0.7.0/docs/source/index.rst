|PyTecplot|: |Tecplot 360 EX| Python Library
============================================

The pytecplot library is a high level API that connects your Python script
to the power of the |Tecplot 360 EX| visualization engine. It offers line
plotting, 2D and 3D surface plots in a variety of formats, and 3D volumetric
visualization. Familiarity with |Tecplot 360 EX| and the |Tecplot 360 EX|
macro language is helpful, but not required.

.. note::
    |PyTecplot| supports 64-bit Python versions 2.7 and 3.4+. |PyTecplot|
    does not support 32 bit Python. Please refer to `Installation` for
    installation instructions and environment setup. For the best
    experience, developers are encouraged to use the **latest version of
    Python**. If you need help converting to Python 3 or wish to write code
    compatible with 2 and 3, please refer to the `Python-Future Cheat Sheet
    <http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html>`_.
