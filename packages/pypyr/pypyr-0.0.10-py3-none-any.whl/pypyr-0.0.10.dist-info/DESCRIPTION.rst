*pypyr*
    pronounce how you like, but I generally say *piper* as in "piping down the
    valleys wild"


pypyr is a command line interface to run pipelines defined in yaml.

Installation
============

pip
---
.. code-block:: bash

  # pip install --upgrade pypyr

Python version
--------------
Test against Python 3.x

Usage
=====


Testing
=======
Testing without worrying about dependencies
-------------------------------------------
Run from tox to test the packaging cycle inside a virtual env, plus run all
tests:

  .. code-block:: bash

      # just run tests
      $ tox -e dev -- tests
      # run tests, validate README.rst, run flake8 linter
      $ tox -e stage -- tests

If tox is taking too long
-------------------------
The test framework is pytest. If you only want to run tests:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install -e .[dev,test]

Day-to-day testing
------------------
- Tests live under /tests (surprising, eh?). Mirror the directory structure of
  the code being tested.
- Prefix a test definition with `test_` - so a unit test looks like

  .. code-block:: python

    def test_this_should_totally_work():

- To execute tests, from root directory:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests

- For a bit more info on running tests:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pytest --verbose [path]

- To execute a specific test module:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests/unit/arb_test_file.py
