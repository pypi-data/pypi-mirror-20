Issue submission
****************

| Issues are tracked on GitHub:
| https://github.com/secynic/ipwhois/issues


Follow the guidelines detailed in the appropriate section below. As a general
rule of thumb, provide as much information as possible when submitting issues.

Bug reports
===========

- Title should be a short, descriptive summary of the bug
- Include the Python and ipwhois versions affected
- Provide a context (with code example) in the description of your issue. What
  are you attempting to do?
- Include the full obfuscated output. Make sure to set DEBUG logging:
  ::

    import logging
    LOG_FORMAT = ('[%(asctime)s] [%(levelname)s] [%(filename)s:%(lineno)s] '
       '[%(funcName)s()] %(message)s')
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=LOG_FORMAT)
- Include sources of information with links or screenshots
- Do you have a suggestion on how to fix the bug?

Feature Requests
================

- Title should be a short, descriptive summary of the feature requested
- Provide use case examples
- Include sources of information with links or screenshots
- Do you have a suggestion on how to implement the feature?

Testing
=======

You may have noticed that Travis CI tests are taking longer to complete.
This is due to the enabling of online lookup tests (network tests in the
ipwhois/tests/online directory).

When running local tests, you may include these tests by adding the
--include=online flag to your nosetests command.

Example::

    nosetests -v -w ipwhois --include=online

Questions
=========

I am happy to answer any questions and provide assistance where possible.
Please be clear and concise. Provide examples when possible. Check the
ipwhois `documentation <https://ipwhois.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ and the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/secynic/ipwhois/issues>`_ before asking a
question.
