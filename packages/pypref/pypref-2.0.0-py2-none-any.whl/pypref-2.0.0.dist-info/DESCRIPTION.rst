PYthon PREFrences or pypref is a python implementation to creating application's configuration, preferences or settings file and dynamically interacting, updating and pulling them. Most applications have default preferences and in general those are created and stored in a text file (.ini, xml, json, etc). At some point preferences are pulled and updated by the application and/or users. pypref is especially designed to take care of this task automatically and make programming application's preferences more desirable. In addition, pypref allows creating dynamic preferences that will be evaluated real time. This becomes handy in plethora of applications for authentication, automatic key generation, etc.
