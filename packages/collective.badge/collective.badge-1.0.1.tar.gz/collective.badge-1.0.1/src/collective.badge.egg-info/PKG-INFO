        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This package adds a content type for representing badges that can be assigned to users.
        
        Each badge has an image and a roster (provided using collective.workspace) which includes:
        
        - User
        - Date Assigned
        - Assigned By
        - Expiration
        
        The package is developed and tested on Plone 5.
        
        An example of its use is on Plone.org, e.g. https://plone.org/profile/davisagli

            >>> badge.list_active_users()
            ['admin']
        
        Remove a badge from a user::
