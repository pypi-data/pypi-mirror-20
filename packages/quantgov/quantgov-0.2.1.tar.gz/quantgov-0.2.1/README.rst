QuantGov
========

The QuantGov library is a companion to the `QuantGov Platform
<http://www.quantgov.org>`_. It provides an easy way to start a new project
using the ``quantgov start`` set of commands, and also provides a set of
classes and functions often used in the QuantGov framework.

To install the library, use ``pip install quantgov``.
