    JavaScript bundle.

    It may also define :py:attr:`apply_to`, which is a list of URL names that
    the extension will be initialized on. If not provided, the extension will
    be initialized on all pages.

    To provide additional data to the model instance, the JSExtension subclass
    can implement :py:meth:`get_model_data` and return a dictionary of data
    to pass. You may also override the :py:meth`get_settings` method to return,
    a dict of settings to the :py:class:`model_class`. By default, the
    associated extension's settings are returned.

class Extension(object):
    """Base class for an extension.

    Extensions must subclass for this class. They'll automatically have
    support for settings, adding hooks, and plugging into the administration
    UI.


    Configuration
    -------------

    If an extension supports configuration in the UI, it should set
    :py:attr:`is_configurable` to True.

    If an extension would like to specify defaults for the settings
    dictionary it should provide a dictionary in :py:attr:`default_settings`.

    If an extension would like a django admin site for modifying the database,
    it should set :py:attr:`has_admin_site` to True.


    Static Media
    ------------

    Extensions should list all other extension names that they require in
    :py:attr:`requirements`.

    Extensions can define static media bundle for Less/CSS and JavaScript
    files, which will automatically be compiled, minified, combined, and
    packaged. An Extension class can define a :py:attr:`css_bundles` and
    a :py:attr:`js_bundles`. Each is a dictionary mapping bundle names
    to bundle dictionary. These mostly follow the Django Pipeline bundle
    format.

    For example:

        class MyExtension(Extension):
            css_bundles = {
                'default': {
                    'source_filenames': ['css/default.css'],
                    'output_filename': 'css/default.min.css',
                },
            }

    ``source_filenames`` is a list of files within the extension module's
    static/ directory that should be bundled together. When testing against
    a developer install with ``DEBUG = True``, these files will be individually
    loaded on the page. However, in a production install, with a properly
    installed extension package, the compiled bundle file will be loaded
    instead, offering a file size and download savings.

    ``output_filename`` is optional. If not specified, the bundle name will
    be used as a base for the filename.

    A bundle name of ``default`` is special. It will be loaded automatically
    on any page supporting extensions (provided the ``load_extensions_js`` and
    ``load_extensions_css`` template tags are used).

    Bundles can also specify an optional ``apply_to`` field, which is a list
    of URL names for pages that the bundle should be automatically loaded on.
    This works like the ``default`` bundle, but for those specific pages.

    Bundles can also be loaded manually within a TemplateHook template
    by using ``{% ext_css_bundle extension "bundle-name" %}`` or
    ``{% ext_js_bundle extension "bundle-name" %}``.


    JavaScript extensions
    ---------------------

    An Extension subclass can define one or more JavaScript extension classes,
    which may apply across all pages or only a subset of them.

    Each is defined as a :py:class:`JSExtension` subclass, and listed in
    Extension's :py:attr:`js_extensions` list. See the documentation on
    JSExtension for more information.

    Any page using the ``init_js_extensions`` template tag will automatically
    initialize any JavaScript extensions appropriate for that page, passing the
    server-stored settings.


    Middleware
    ----------

    If an extension has any middleware, it should set :py:attr:`middleware`
    to a list of class names. This extension's middleware will be loaded after
    any middleware belonging to any extensions in the :py:attr:`requirements`
    list.


    Template Context Processors
    ---------------------------

    Extensions may need to provide additional context variables to templates.
    This can usually be accomplished through a TemplateHook, but sometimes
    it's necessary to provide context variables for other pages (such as
    those controlled by a third-party module).

    To add additional context processors, set :py:attr:`context_processors`
    to a list of class names. They will be added to
    ``settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` automatically.
