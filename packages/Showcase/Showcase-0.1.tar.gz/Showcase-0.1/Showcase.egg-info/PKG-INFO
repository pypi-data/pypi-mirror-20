Description: ========
        Showcase
        ========
        
        A slightly nicer, probably less secure version of ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer``.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ``pip install showcase``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Not for production use, etc, but in development, something like::
        
            FLASK_APP=showcase.app FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
        
        and in production, something more like::
        
            gunicorn showcase:app
        
        To have it start somewhere other than where it is installed, set the ``SHOWCASE_DIR`` environment variable.
