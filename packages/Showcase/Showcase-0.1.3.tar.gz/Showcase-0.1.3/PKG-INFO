Description: ========
        Showcase
        ========
        
        A slightly nicer, probably less secure version of ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer``.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ``pip install showcase``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Not for production use, etc, but something like::
        
            FLASK_APP=showcase.app FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
        
        or, using ``gunicorn``::
        
            gunicorn showcase:app -b 127.0.0.1:5000
        
        Once it's running, head to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and enjoy.
        
        To browse somewhere other than where it is installed, set the ``SHOWCASE_DIR`` environment variable::
        
            SHOWCASE_DIR=$(pwd) gunicorn showcase:app -b 127.0.0.1:5000
