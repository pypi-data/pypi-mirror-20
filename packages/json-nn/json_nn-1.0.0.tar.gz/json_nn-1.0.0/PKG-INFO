        =======
        
        JSON parsing, powered by neural networks. What could go wrong?
        
        Requires Tensorflow 1.0.0 or later. Please don't use this in production :)

        Usage
        -----
        
        Quickstart: ``pip install json_nn``.
        
        To install from source, run ``python setup.py install``.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from json_nn import JsonNN
        
            parser = JsonNN()
            print(parser.parse("""
            {
                "classes": [
                    {
                        "dates":{
                            "start_time": "11:30", "end_time": "12:50", "weekdays": "F",
                            "start_date": null, "end_date": null,
                            "is_tba": false, "is_cancelled": false, "is_closed": false
                        },
                        "location":{"building": "MC", "room": "3003"},
                        "instructors": []
                    }
                ]
            }
            """))
        
            # prints out the following:
            # {'classes': [{'location': {'room': '3003', 'building': 'MC'}, 'dates': {'is_cancelled': False, 'start_time': '11:30', 'start_date': None, 'is_tba': False, 'end_date': None, 'end_time': '12:50', 'weekdays': 'F', 'is_closed': False}, 'instructors': []}]}
