        The **type** is a user defined string that can be used by
        **rules** to select all buckets of the same type.

        The **name** is a user defined string that uniquely identify
        the bucket.

        The **id** must either be set for all buckets or not at
        all. If the **id** is provided, it must be a unique negative
        number. If it is not provided, the first available id is
        used.

        The **weight** must either be set for all buckets or not at
        all. If not set, **weight** defaults to the cumulated weight
        of the immediate children bucket or devices, recursively,
        bottom to top.

        Children within a bucket are chosen with one of three
        **algorithms** representing a tradeoff between performance
        and reorganization efficiency. If you are unsure, we recommend
        using **"straw2"**. The table summarizes how the speed of each
        option measures up against mapping stability when items are
        added or removed::

            Bucket Alg     Speed       Additions    Removals
            ------------------------------------------------
            "straw2"        O(n)       optimal      optimal
            "uniform"       O(1)       poor         poor
            "list"          O(n)       optimal      poor

        - **"straw2"**: List and tree buckets are structured such that
          a limited number of hash values need to be calculated and
          compared to weights in order to select a bucket child. In
          doing so, they divide and conquer in a way that either gives
          certain children precedence (e. g., those at the beginning
          of a list) or obviates the need to consider entire subtrees
          of children at all. That improves the performance of the
          replica placement process, but can also introduce suboptimal
          reorganization behavior when the contents of a bucket change
          due an addition, removal, or re-weighting of an child. The
          straw2 bucket type allows all children to fairly `compete`
          against each other for replica placement through a process
          analogous to a draw of straws. To place a replica, a straw
          of random length is drawn for each child in the bucket.  The
          child with the longest straw wins.  The length of each straw
          is initially a value in a fixed range.  Each straw length is
          scaled by a factor based on the child’s weight so that
          heavily weighted children are more likely to win the draw.
          Although this process is almost twice as slow (on average)
          than a list bucket and even slower than a tree bucket (which
          scales logarithmically), straw2 buckets result in optimal
          data movement between nested children when modified.

        - **"uniform"**: Devices are rarely added individually in a
          large system.  Instead, new storage is typically deployed in
          blocks of identical devices, often as an additional shelf in
          a server rack or perhaps an entire cabinet. Devices reaching
          their end of life are often similarly decommissioned as a
          set (individual failures aside), making it natural to treat
          them as a unit. Uniform buckets are used to represent an
          identical set of devices in such circumstances. The key
          advantage in doing so is performance related: Crush can map
          replicas into uniform buckets in constant time. In cases
          where the uniformity restrictions are not appropriate, other
          bucket types can be used. If the size of a uniform bucket
          changes, there is a complete reshuffling of data between
          devices, much like conventional hash-based distribution
          strategies.

        - **"list"**: List buckets structure their contents as a
          linked list, and can contain children with arbitrary
          weights.  To place a replica, Crush begins at the head of
          the list with the most recently added child and compares its
          weight to the sum of all remaining children’ weights.
          Depending on the value of the hash function, either the
          current child is chosen with the appropriate probability, or
          the process continues recursively down the list. This is a
          natural and intuitive choice for an expanding cluster:
          either an object is relocated to the newest device with some
          appropriate probability, or it remains on the older devices
          as before.  The result is optimal data migration when
          children are added to the bucket. Children removed from the
          middle or tail of the list, however, can result in a
          significant amount of unnecessary movement, making list
          buckets most suitable for circumstances in which they never
          (or very rarely) shrink.

        There children may be ommited.
        ::

            children = [
              # optional (default: none)
              bucket or device,
              bucket or device,
              ...
            ]

        Each element can either be a device (i.e. no children and id >= 0)
        or a bucket (i.e. id < 0).
        ::

            device = {

        The **id** must be a unique positive number.

        The **name** is a user defined string that uniquely identify
        the bucket.

        If the **weight** of a device A is lower than the
        **weight** of a device B, it will be less likely to be used.
        A common pattern is to set the **weight** to 2.0 for 2TB
        devices, 1.0 for 1TB devices, 0.5 for 500GB devices, etc.

              <rule name str>: rule,
              ...

        A **rule** maps an object (see the map function) to a list
        of devices. There can be multiple rules depending on the
        mapping strategy.
        ::

            rule = [ step, step, ... ]

        The **rule** interprets each **step** in sequence and the last
        one must be **"emit"**.

        Recursively explore each bucket currently selected, looking for
        **replication count** buckets of the required **bucket type**
        and select them.

        **firstn** is best suited when the order of the result does not matter,
        for instance to place object replicas. **indep** is best suited when
        the order of the result makes a difference, for instance to place parts
        of an erasure coded object.

        If **replication count** is zero, the number of buckets
        to select will be determined by the `replication_count` argument of
        the `map` method, i.e. **replication count** is set to
        match the desired number of replicas.
