Matchers
========

Matchers are in charge of extract software version.
There are two big groups: static and javascript matchers.


Static matchers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three types of static matchers:

* URL (``url``): operate on request/response URLs made by the website.
* Body (``body``): operate on response body.
* Header (``header``): operate on request/response headers.
  Useful to analyze cookie content too.

Matchers are usually regular expressions (functions are also supported)
and they **must** have a named parameter ``version``.
In example, *MomentJS* plugin has the following URL matcher:


.. code-block:: python

  matchers = [
    {'url': '/moment\.js/(?P<version>[0-9\.]+)/moment(\.min)?\.js'},
  ]


Javascript matchers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Javascript matchers are evaluated on the page DOM_.
It makes easy the cases where it's hard to write reliable static matchers
due to page measures.
In example, this D3.js_ `example <https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4061502>`_
uses a minified version of `D3.js library <https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js>`_.
If you see, it's hard to extract version in a reliable and generic way
since it's hold in a not meaningful variable
and recompiling the library could change the variable name.

However, this minified script create the ``D3`` object in the DOM_,
then using ``D3.version`` we could get the version reliably.
Taking the example from the D3.js_ plugin:

.. code-block:: python

  js_matchers = [
    {'check': 'window.d3', 'version': 'window.d3.version'},
  ]

It has two fields:

* ``check``: Javascript code to verify if the target object exists.
  Usually you use ``window.object`` since it doesn't raise an error.
* ``version``: Javascript code to get software version.
  It has ``window`` as prefix to make easier the testing
  (it's valid in the browser and testing environment)

Both fields are evaluated in the Javascript context of the page.
For sanity purposes,
it's a good idea to keep the ``window`` object
since without it could lead to unexpected results in presence of iframes.
