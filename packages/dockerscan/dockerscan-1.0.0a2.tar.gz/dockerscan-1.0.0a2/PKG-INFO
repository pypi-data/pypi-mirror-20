        Very quick install
        ==================

            > python3.5 -m pip install -U pip
            > python3.5 -m pip install dockerscan
        
        Show options:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            > dockerscan -h
        
        Available actions
        =================
        
        Currently Docker Scan support these actions:
        
        - Scan: Scan a network trying to locate Docker Registries
        
        - Registry
        
            - Delete: Delete remote image / tag
            - Info: Show info from remote registry
            - Push: Push an image (like Docker client)
            - Upload: Upload a random file
        
        - Image
        
            - Analyze: Looking for sensitive information in a Docker image.
        
                - Looking for passwords in environment vars.
                - Try to find any URL / IP in the environment vars.
                - Try to deduce the user used internally to run the software. This is not trivial. If the entry point is a .sh file. Read the file and try to find call to sudo-like: “sudo”, “gosu”, “sh -u”… And report the user found.
        
            - Extract: extract a docker image
            - Info: Get a image meta information
            - Modify:
        
                - entrypoint: change the entrypoint in a docker
                - **trojanize**: inject a reverser shell into a docker image
                - user: change running user in a docker image
        
        What's the difference from Clair or Docker Cloud?
        =================================================
        
        The purpose of Dockerscan is different. It's focussed in the attack phase.
        
        Although Dockescan has some functionalities to detect vulnerabilities in Docker images and Docker registries, the objective is the attack.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Documentation is still in progress... sorry!
        
        For the moment we only have the slides presented at RootedCON Spain, the conference where Docker Scan was presented:
        
        https://www.slideshare.net/secret/fxVqD2iXqanOCX
        
        Or you can watch it in video format (recommended):
