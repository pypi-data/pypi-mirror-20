Description: django painless redirects
        ============
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/bnzk/django-painless-redirects.svg
            :target: https://travis-ci.org/bnzk/django-painless-redirects
        
        like django.contrib.redirects, on steroids. maybe.
        
        Implemented:
        
        - simple redirects table, with that bit more flexibility / convenience
            - limited wildcard matching
            - move complete trees
            - decide if you want to keep GET vars
        - force site domain middleware, that redirects to current site's domain, if not already there
        
        Yet to be done:
        
        - APPEND_SLASH handling (when trying to redirect /whatever/was-here.html)
        - contrib packages with "magic" redirects for django-cms, django-filer -> SEO is easy.
        
        
        Installation & Usage
        ------------
        
        To get the latest stable release from PyPi
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install django-painless-redirects
        
        Add ``painless_redirects`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'painless_redirects',
            )
        
        Add the following middlware to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES (1.10 style middlewares will be supported soon),
        to make basic redirects work.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            painless_redirects.middleware.ManualRedirectMiddleware
        
        If you want to be redirected to the domain name entered in your current site (django.contrib.sites must be installed),
        also add this middleware:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
            painless_redirects.middleware.ForceSiteDomainRedirectMiddleware
        
        
        Development

        - there is test app, available with `./manage.py runserver`.
        - to run tests: ./manage.py test
        - to run tests with django 1.8 / 1.9 / 1.10: `tox`
