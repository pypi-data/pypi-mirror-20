</div>

<p>After all processing has been completed, the designated output directory for the 
<code>qap_functional_spatial.py</code> workflow will contain a set of pdf files that 
contain the relevant reports for the set of scans undergoing quality assessment.
The set of output pdfs includes one pdf file per input scan, e.g.: 
<code>qap_functional_spatial_sub-01.pdf</code>, which contains the mean EPI plot and 
QC metrics for that scan. There will also be a group report pdf in that main output 
directory, e.g.: <code>qap_functional_spatial_group.pdf</code>, that contains summary 
metrics for the entire set of scans.</p>

<h2> For the individual scan reports:</h2>

<h3 id="mosaic">The Mean EPI Slice Mosaic</h3>

<p>This plot in the report for the scan being assessed, e.g.: </p>
<pre><code>Mean EPI image (subject 1_session_1_scan_1)</code></pre>
<p>is the rendering of the axial slices from the 3D stack created by the workflow.
This mean EPI was created by averaging the BOLD signal intensity values in each voxel over time.
Hence, a 3-dimensional image was created from the 4-dimensional scan and was displayed as a slice mosaic.
This image can be used to eyeball the quality of the overall signal in the scan, as it will be obvious if
there were any problem areas where there was signal dropout resulting from a bad shim or other sources of
signal distortion (such as tattoos which contain metallic or ferromagnetic compounds, or permanent makeup).</p>

<h3 id="metrics">The Spatial Metrics computed on the Functional Scan</h3>

<p>The metrics displayed in the Summary Report were computed using the</p>
<pre><code>qap_functional_spatial.py </code></pre>
<p>workflow and have been displayed as violin plots. The stars in these plots denote 
where the score for this particular scan falls in the distribution of all scores for 
scans that were included as inputs to this workflow.</p>

<p>The metrics computed are as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>EFC - Entropy Focus Criterion</li>
	<li>FBER - Foreground to Background Energy Ratio</li>
	<li>FWHM - Full-width half maximum smoothness of the voxels averaged across the three 
	coordinate axes, and also for each axis [x,y,x]</li>
	<li>Ghost - Ghost to Signal Ratio </li>
	<li>SNR -  Signal to Noise Ratio</li>
</ol>

<p>All metrics are described in more detail in the 
<a href="http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.github.io/quality-assessment-protocol/#taxonomy-of-qa-measures" target="_blank" >Taxonomy of QA Measures section</a> of the QAP documentation. Please refer to the QAP website for descriptions of these metrics.</p>


<h2> For the group reports:</h2>

<p>The violin plots included in the group report, e.g.: <code>QC measures (session_1)</code>
are a graphical representation of the columnar values in the <code>qap_functional_spatial.csv</code>
file that was created in the main output directory for the workflow. The scores for each metric
described above were aggregated to create the distributions that were plotted in both the individual
and group reports. Hence, the violin plots in the individual scan reports and the group reports are
identical, except that the group reports do not contain any stars denoting individual scans.
These group reports are intended to provide the user a means of visually inspecting the overall 
quality of the spatial data for that group of functional scans.</p>
