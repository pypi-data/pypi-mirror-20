Description: URLExtract
        ----------
        
        URLExtract is python class for collecting (extracting) URLs from given
        text.
        
        How does it work
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        It tries to find any occurrence of TLD in given text. If TLD is found it
        starts from that position to expand boundaries to both sides searching
        for "stop character" (usually whitespace, comma, single or double
        quote).
        
        NOTE: List of TLDs is downloaded from iana.org to keep you up to date with new TLDs.
