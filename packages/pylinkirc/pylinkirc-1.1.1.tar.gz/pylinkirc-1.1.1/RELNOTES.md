# PyLink 1.1.1

The "Crush" release. Changes from 1.1.0:

#### Bug fixes
- The `pylink-mkpasswd` program is actually installed now when using `pip` (PyPI) or `setup.py`.
- Backported protocol module fixes from 1.2-dev:
    - unreal: fix crashes when receiving `SJOIN` with only a prefix and no UID
    - inspircd: work around extraneous letters sent in `FJOIN` timestamps (Anope 1.8.x bug)
    - nefarious: fix a typo causing crashes on user mode changes
- Relay: in `claim`, show a less ambiguous error when a relay channel doesn't exist on the caller's network.
- corecommands: removed extraneous `irc.checkAuthenticated()` call

#### Feature changes
- `pylink-mkpasswd` now supports interactive password input via getpass, which is more secure than passing passwords raw on the command line.

#### Misc changes
- More prominent migration notes regarding permissions and new accounts system.

# PyLink 1.1.0

The "Calico" release. This is mostly a cleanup and documentation update from 1.1-beta2, with the following additional change:
- Made passlib an optional dependency (password hashing will be disabled if passlib isn't installed), simplifying the upgrade process.

For a full list of changes since 1.0.x, see the release notes for the 1.1 alpha & beta series. Summary of major changes since 1.0.x:

- :closed_lock_with_key: **Redone authentication configuration**, now supporting **multiple accounts**, hashed passwords, and fine-tuned permissions.
   - Old configurations using `login:user` and `login:password` will still work, but are now deprecated. Consider migrating to the new `login:` block in the example config.
   - This also adds a new optional dependency of passlib (https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is required for the password hashing portion.
- Protocol modules now wrap long messages (SJOIN and MODE) to prevent cutoff shenanigans from happening.
   - This fixes a particularly nasty bug that can corrupt the TS on UnrealIRCd channels if a MODE command sets more than 12 modes at once (#393).
- Added utilities to download contrib modules (`pylink-contribdl`) and hash passwords for the new accounts configuration (`pylink-mkpasswd`).
- Most plugins were ported to the permissions API.
- Clientbot now supports mode syncing, SASL (with optional reauth), and IRCv3 multi-prefix.
- Services bots now support setting modes on themselves on join: see "joinmodes" in the example conf
- Changehost gained a few new features, including optional (per network) vHost enforcement.
- Added a `bindhost` option in server blocks, for multi-homed hosts.
- PID file checking was implemented - Run PyLink with the `--check-pid` argument in order to turn it on.
- The `ts6` protocol module now supports `KICK` without arguments and legacy `UID` introduction (for older servers / services).
- Relay: added a `purge` command to remove all relays involving a network.
- Added support for ircd-ratbox (`ratbox` protocol module).
- Changing the console log level via REHASH now works.
- New `servermaps` plugin, displaying network `/map`'s from the PyLink server's perspective.

# PyLink 1.1-beta2

The "Conscience" release. Changes from 1.1-beta1:

#### Bug fixes

- Protocol modules now wrap longer messages (SJOIN and MODE) to prevent cutoff shenanigans from happening.
    - This fixes a particularly nasty bug that can corrupt the TS on UnrealIRCd channels if a MODE command sets more than 12 modes at once (#393).
- Pong handling is a lot less strict now (it just makes sure the sender is the uplink). In other words, fix issues on UnrealIRCd where PONGs get ignored if the argument doesn't match the server name exactly (e.g. different case).
- Clientbot protocol fixes:
    - Fix SASL PLAIN auth on Python 3.4 (TypeError with bytes formatting with `%b`).
    - Don't repeat KICK hooks if the source is internal: this prevents KICK events from being relayed twice to Clientbot links, when the kicked user is also a Clientbot user.
    - Clientbot now explicitly sends `/names` after join, to guarantee a response.
    - Fix message recognition treating nick prefixes without `ident@host` as servers (this polluted the state)
    - Fix prefix mode changes for unknown/missing users in `/who` causing KeyError crashes
- ts6: fix setting mode `-k *` not working due to wrongly ordered logic (1.1-dev regression)
- ts6: fix handling of KICK without a reason argument
- Automode: remove some repeated "Error:" text in error messages
- `IrcChannel` no longer assumes `+nt` on new channels, as this is not necessarily correct

#### Feature changes
- Changing the console log level via REHASH is now supported.
- Added a bind host option for multi-homed hosts.

#### Internal improvements
- updateTS now ignores any broken TS values lower than 750000, instead of propagating them (e.g. over relay) and making the problem worse.
- The UnrealIRCd protocol module was updated to actually use extended SJOIN (SJ3). This should make bursts/startup more efficient, as modes, users, and bans are now sent together.

# PyLink 1.1-beta1

The "Crunchy" release. This release includes all bug fixes from PyLink 1.0.4, along with the following:

### Changes from 1.1-alpha1

#### Feature changes
- Most plugins were ported to use the permissions API, meaning multiple accounts are actually useful now!
    - Having a **PyLink login** with *new* style accounts **no longer implies access to everything** on the PyLink daemon. See the updated example conf regarding the new `permissions:` block.
    - **Logins implying admin access** is limited to **old accounts ONLY** (i.e. logins defined via login:user/password)
    - The `commands` plugin now has permissions checks for `echo`, `showuser`, `showchan`, and `status`. The latter three are granted to all users (`*!*@*`) by default, while `echo` is restricted.
- Clientbot now supports IRCv3 SASL (with optional reauth!) and multi-prefix. See the example conf for details on the former (the latter is enabled automatically when available).
- PID file checking is now **disabled** by default for better migration from 1.0.x. Run PyLink with `--check-pid` in order to turn it on.
- commands: add a new `logout` command (#370)
- The `list` command now supports optionally filtering commands by plugin.

#### Bug fixes
- The permission to use servermaps is now `servermaps.map` instead of `servermap.map`.
- networks: fix the `remote` command to work with permissions (i.e. override the correct account name)
- relay: add missing permissions check on the `linked` command

#### Internal fixes / improvements
- relay: rewrite host normalization to whitelist instead of blacklist characters. This should improve compatibility with IRCds as previously untested characters are introduced.
- relay_clientbot: faster colour hashing using built-in `hash()` instead of md5
- opercmds: removed the source argument from `kick` and `kill`; it's confusing and isn't very useful

#### Misc. changes
- Documentation updates: add a permissions reference, document advanced relay config, etc.

# PyLink 1.0.4
Tagged as **1.0.4** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol)

The "Bonfire" release.

#### Bug fixes
- protocols: implement basic nick collision detection in UID handlers. This fixes users potentially going missing on UnrealIRCd networks, if the remote IRCd introduces a user of the same nick *after* PyLink does. Thanks to kevin for reporting!
- relay: strip underscores (`_`) from hosts on ts6 and ratbox, fixing possible invalid user@host errors
- Backported fixes from 1.1.x / devel:
    - Demote "unknown user" warnings in mode handling to DEBUG, suppressing warnings when old services like Anope 1.8 set modes on users as they quit.
    - Fix `irc.matchHost()` confusing the `realhost` boolean to be the same as `ip`.
    - changehost: add missing permissions check to `applyhosts`; it now requires the `changehost.applyhost` permission.

#### Misc changes
- networks: update help for `disconnect` to reflect how it now always disables autoconnect.

# PyLink 1.1-alpha1

The "Candescent" release.

### Changes from 1.0.3

#### Feature changes
- **Clientbot now supports optional mode syncing** :tada: See the example conf for how to configure it (look for "modesync").
- PID file checking has been implemented and is turned on by default. :warning: **When upgrading from 1.0.x, remove `pylink.pid` before starting!**
- Revamped login configuration system, which now supports **multiple accounts and hashed passwords**
    - :warning: `login:user` and `login:password` are now deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Consider migrating to the new `login:` block in the example config.
    - Hashing new passwords can be done using the `mkpasswd` command via IRC, or the new command line utility `pylink-mkpasswd`.
- Services bots now support setting modes on themselves on join: see "joinmodes" in the example conf
- Added a contrib module downloader (`pylink-contribdl`)
- Relay now uses the PyLink permission system. The following permissions are now available:
	- Granted to opers by default:
		- `relay.create`
		- `relay.destroy`
		- `relay.claim`
		- `relay.link`
		- `relay.delink`
		- `relay.linkacl.view`
		- `relay.linkacl`
	- Granted to all users by default:
		- `relay.linked`
	- And the following which is not explicitly granted:
		- `relay.savedb`
- Relay: added a `purge` command to remove all relays involving a network
- Automode now supports remote channel manipulation in the form `netname#channel` (#352)
- protocols/ts6 now supports legacy UID introduction, for older servers / services
- Changehost gained a few new features (look for "changehost:" in the example conf):
    - Optional (per network) vHost enforcement: now you can create spoofs like freenode without using their IRCd!
    - Enforcement exceptions for the feature above
    - Options to enable/disable matching users by IP and real host
- New protocol support for `ircd-ratbox`, based off `ts6`
- New servermaps plugin, displaying network `/map`'s from the PyLink server's perspective. Relay links can be expanded as well to make this more detailed!
- Oper status tracking is now a network-specific option, for better security. Look for "track_oper_statuses" in the example config.
- The PyLink launcher now sets the terminal title on launch (Windows & POSIX)
- relay: implement a complementary `showchan` command, showing a list of relay links

#### Bug fixes
- Relay is potentially less crashy when PyLink is split off while it tries to introduce users (#354).
- The `bots` plugin now allows JOIN/NICK/PART on all service bots
- Relay: skip channel TS check for Clientbot (some users had this as a sporadic issue)
- Irc: explicitly kill connect loop threads after an Irc object has been removed. This fixes various freezing issues caused by ghosted connections after a network splits (#351).
- Relay: don't error when removing a channel from a network that isn't connected. (AttributeError on `removeChannel()` if `irc.pseudoclient` isn't set)

#### Internal fixes / improvements
- Server ID and service client name (if applicable) are now stored inside `IrcUser` objects, removing the need for some expensive reverse lookups
- Relay and Automode now use a centralized DataStore (backwards compatible) in `structures` for their database implementation
- Docstring rewrapping is now supported for neater, wrappable docstrings! (#307)
- `Irc.error()` was added for easier error replies; it is a simple wrapper around `Irc.reply()`
- Relay now uses locks in DB read/writes, for thread safety
- Most camel case functions in Relay were renamed to lowercase with underscores (PEP 8)

#### Misc. changes
- exec: Drop `raw` text logging to DEBUG to prevent information leakage (e.g. passwords on Clientbot)
- Removed `update.sh` (my convenience script for locally building + running PyLink)

# [PyLink 1.0.3](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/1.0.3)
Tagged as **1.0.3** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-11-20T04:51:11Z

The "Buoyant" release.

### Changes from 1.0.2

#### Bug fixes
- Fixed invalid database names such as "automode-/tmp/test.db" from being generated when PyLink is started with an absolute path to its config.
- Backported fixes from 1.1-dev:
    - relay: skip channel TS checks for Clientbot, preventing possible "channel too old" errors on link.

#### Feature changes
- Backported features from 1.1-dev:
    - Relay: allow configuring custom relay server suffixes

#### Misc. changes
- Various spelling/grammar fixes in the example config.

# [PyLink 1.0.2](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/1.0.2)
Tagged as **1.0.2** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-10-15T05:52:37Z

The "Baluga" release.

### Changes from 1.0.1

#### Bug fixes
- Clientbot: Fixed nick collisions between virtual clients and real users (#327)
- Fix typo in example conf that caused `log::filerotation` to become an empty, `None`-valued block. This in turn caused the `log` module to crash.

#### Feature changes
- Clientbot now uses a more specific realname fallback ("PyLink Relay Mirror Client") instead of potentially misleading text such as "PyLink Service Client". In the future, this text may be made configurable.

#### Internal fixes / improvements
 - setup.py: reworded warnings if `git describe --tags` fails / fallback version is used. Also, the internal VCS version for non-Git builds is now `-nogit` instead of `-dirty`.

# [PyLink 1.0.1](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/1.0.1)
Tagged as **1.0.1** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-10-06T02:13:42Z

The "Beam" release.

### Changes from 1.0.0

#### Bug fixes

- **Fix PyLink being uninstallable via PyPI due to missing VERSION and README.md**
- ts6: don't crash when CHGHOST target is a nick instead of UID
- relay: clobber colour codes in hosts
- bots: allow JOIN/NICK/QUIT on ServiceBot clients

# [PyLink 1.0.0](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/1.0.0)
Tagged as **1.0.0** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-09-17T05:25:51Z

The "Benevolence" release.

### Changes from 1.0-beta1

#### Bug fixes
- Clientbot now relays text sent from service bots.
- Fixed KeyErrors in Clientbot when receiving WHO replies for clients we don't know -- these are now ignored.
- Relay now skips mode type definitions when doing reverse mode lookup. This fixes channel mode `+l` mever being relayed UnrealIRCd, because `+l` happened to be the only supported type C mode.
- protocols/nefarious: fix UnboundLocalError when no modes are given on user introduction
- fantasy: don't error when bots are removed while processing a message (e.g. on shutdown)

#### Feature changes
- Automode now limits `listacc` to opers instead of all users (with default permissions settings).

#### Internal fixes / improvements
- Fixed incomplete hook payload keys from 1.0-beta1 (`oldchan`/`chandata` -> `channeldata`)
- services_support: hack away nick clashes between service clients & real users from Clientbot networks
- clientbot: downgrade bad updateClient() calls to warning

#### Misc. changes
- Documentation updates: Automode+permissions guide, README refresh, others.
- Example configuration changes:
  - Automode's bot nick now defaults to "Automode" instead of "ModeBot" for consistency.
  - Added a debug log example <sup><sup><sup>because nobody knew how to turn it on</sup></sup></sup>
  - Fix inverted option description for Relay's `show_netsplits` option.

# [PyLink 1.0-beta1](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/1.0-beta1)
Tagged as **1.0-beta1** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-09-03T07:49:12Z

The "Badgers" release. Note: This is an **beta** build and may not be completely stable!

### Changes from 0.10-alpha1

#### Bug fixes
- Fixes for the Clientbot protocol module:
    - Fix `nick()` referring to the wrong variables (and thus not working at all)
    - Fix crashes caused by forced nick changes on connect
    - Clientbot now only sends `CHGHOST/CHGIDENT/CHGNAME` hooks the field has actually changed
- Automode now joins the Modebot client on `setacc`, if not already present

#### Feature changes
- Irc: implement basic message queueing (1 message sent per X seconds, where X defaults to 0.01 for servers) .
    - This appears to also workaround sporadic SSL errors causing disconnects (https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/246)
- relay: CLAIM is now more resistant to things like `/OJOIN` abuse<sup><sup><sup>Seriously people, show some respect for your linked networks ;)</sup></sup></sup>.
- core: New permissions system, used exclusively by Automode at this time. See `example-permissions.yml` in the Git tree for configuration options.
- relay_clientbot now optionally supports PMs with users linked via Clientbot. This can be enabled via the `relay::allow_clientbot_pms` option, and provides the following behaviour:
    - Private messages and notices *TO* Clientbot users are forwarded from the Relay bot as NOTICE.
    - Private messages can be sent *FROM* Clientbot users using the `rpm` command in `relay_clientbot`
- The PyLink launcher now shows the full VCS version in `pylink -v`
- Revert "relay_clientbot: always lowercase network name (stylistic choice)"

#### Internal fixes / improvements
- protocols/unreal: use umode `+xt` instead of blind `/SETHOST` when spawning users
- protocols/clientbot: handle numerics 463 (ERR_NOPERMFORHOST), 464 (ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH), and 465 (ERR_YOUREBANNEDCREEP) as fatal errors
- protocols: various fields in hook payloads are renamed for consistency:
    - The `chandata` field in SQUIT payloads is renamed to `channeldata`
    - The `oldchan` field in MODE payloads is renamed to `channeldata`
- `Irc.msg()` should no longer send empty text strings (which are technically illegal) in things like help strings.
- Irc: make sending of loopback hooks in `msg()` optional
- relay_clientbot: switch to `irc.msg()` for relayed text

#### Misc. changes
- Various to documentation update and installation instruction improvements.

# [PyLink 0.10-alpha1](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/0.10-alpha1)
Tagged as **0.10-alpha1** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-08-22T00:04:34Z

The "Balloons" release. Note: This is an **alpha** build and may not be completely stable! This version includes all fixes from PyLink 0.9.2, with the following additions:

### Changes from 0.9.2

#### Bug fixes
- Improved syncing between Automode and Relay on JOINs. In other words: fixed Automode sometimes setting modes on join before all of a target's relay clones have joined corresponding relay channels on remote networks.
- protocols/inspircd now tracks required modules for vHost updating (CHGHOST/IDENT/NAME), instead of potentially sending unknown commands to the IRCd and causing a netsplit.
- changehost now explicitly forbids `$host` from being used in expansion fields, preventing vHosts from potentially being set in a loop whenever `applyhosts` is called.
- `eval` now formats empty strings correctly, instead of having no visible reply. In other words, it now wraps all output with `repr()`.
- relay: fix reversed prefix mode order in bursts (e.g. `+@~UID` instead of `~@+UID`). Fortunately, this is minor detail; no noticeable adverse effects to IRCd linking was ever experienced.

#### Feature changes

- **WIP** Clientbot protocol module: allows PyLink to connect as a bot to servers, for purposes such as relay.
    - Some features such as flood protection, services account tracking, and IRCv3 support are still missing.
    - **For Clientbot relay support, remember to also load the `relay_clientbot` plugin!**
- Added the ability to rotate logs at certain sizes, keeping X backups for reference.
- REHASH now updates file logging settings.
- Relay now allows configuring a list of nick globs to always tag nicks (`forcetag_nicks:` block in `relay:`)
- networks: new `reloadproto` command, allowing in-place reloading of protocol modules without restart.
- Ctrl-C / KeyboardInterrupt now cleanly shuts down PyLink (in most cases).
- SSL cert file and key file are now optional.
- changehost: show more friendly errors when an expansion field is unavailable
- protocols/inspircd: add support for SAKICK, ALLTIME.
- protocols/ unreal: add support for TSCTL ALLTIME.
- Added support for `/time` requests.

#### Internal fixes / improvements
- Shutdown now cleanly quits the PyLink service bot instead of simply splitting off.
- PyLink now shows a better error if a protocol module chosen is missing.
- Config key validation is now protocol-specific.
- The `IrcUser.identified` attribute was renamed to `IrcUser.account`.
- exec: make `pylinkirc` and `importlib` accessible for easier debugging.
- SQUIT hooks get a few more arguments, such as `nicks` (affected nicks) and `serverdata` (old IrcServer object).
- Retrieving the hostname used by the current PyLink instance is now a shared function: `irc.hostname()`
- Better handling of empty lines in command help - these are now sent as a single space instead of passing invalid text like `:<UID> NOTICE <UID> :` to the IRCd (no text in the text parameter).
- protocols/ts6: handle incoming ETB (extended topic burst) and EOPMOD (partial support; op moderated +z messages are converted to forms like `@#channel`).
- protocols/unreal: explicitly declare support for ESVID, or account name arguments in service stamps. Realistically this doesn't seem to affect S2S traffic, but it is the correct thing to do.

#### Misc. changes
- `FakeIRC` and `FakeProto` are removed (unused and not updated for 0.10 internal APIs)

# [PyLink 0.9.2](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/0.9.2)
Tagged as **0.9.2** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-08-21T23:59:23Z

The "Acorn" release.

### Changes from 0.9.1

#### Bug fixes

- Relay now treats `{}` as valid characters in nicks.
- Fixed services login tracking for older Anope services + UnrealIRCd. Previously, PyLink would incorrectly store login timestamps as the account name, instead of the user's nick.
- Relay now normalizes `/` to `.` in hostnames on IRCd-Hybrid.
- Cloaked hosts for UnrealIRCd 3.2 users are now applied instead of the real host being visible.

# [PyLink 0.9.1](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/0.9.1)
Tagged as **0.9.1** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-08-07T03:05:01Z

### *Important*, backwards incompatible changes for those upgrading from 0.8.x!
- The configuration file is now **pylink.yml** by default, instead of **config.yml**.
- PyLink now requires installing itself as a module, instead of simply running from source. Do this via `python3 setup.py install --user`.
- The `use_experimental_whois` option for InspIRCd servers and the `spawn_servers` option in Relay have been removed, as they are now implied.

### Changes from 0.9.0

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed various bugs in channel TS handling (this should reduce mode desyncs with relay).
- protocols/unreal: fixed services account support for older services (e.g. Anope < 2.0) that don't explicitly use account names for logins (#296).
- Mode changes are no longer sorted alphabetically when relayed: sorting now only applies for displaying a list of modes, such as in WHOIS.
- Invalid autojoin channels are now ignored, instead of passing potentially invalid data to the IRCd.

#### Feature changes

- `setup.py` now explicitly forbids installing on Python 2 (#297).
- The `nefarious` protocol module now forwards MODE and KICK through servers if the sender isn't opped, preventing many mode bounces, kick failures, and HACK server notices.

#### Internal fixes / improvements

- protocols/hybrid,ts6,unreal: Casemapping-specific lowercasing is now consistently used for channel names
- Relay now catches errors on network removal and ignores them.
- Channels names are now case normalized when receiving `@#channel` messages.

#### Misc. changes
- Minor example configuration updates, including a mention of passwordless UnrealIRCd links by setting recvpass and sendpass to `*`.

Tagged as **0.9.0** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-07-25T05:49:55Z

### *Important*, backwards incompatible changes for those upgrading from 0.8.x!
- The configuration file is now **pylink.yml** by default, instead of **config.yml**.
- PyLink now requires installing itself as a module, instead of simply running from source. Do this via `python3 setup.py install --user`.
- The `use_experimental_whois` option for InspIRCd servers and the `spawn_servers` option in Relay have been removed, as they are now implied.

----

### Changes from 0.9-beta1

##### Added / changed / removed features
- PyLink is now slightly more descriptive if you try to start it with missing dependencies or a missing conf file.
- The PyLink API reference is now at https://pylink.github.io/ instead of in `docs/technical`.
- The `exec` and `eval` commands now have access to the `pylinkirc` and `importlib` imports by default.
- `jupe` from the `opercmds` plugin now requires the admin login instead of just oper.
- opercmds: `kick` now treat channels case insensitively.
- Documentation update: there are now guides to Automode and PyLink's Services API.

##### Bug fixes
- Fixed the `reload` command (again).
- Fixed compatibility with ircmatch 1.2: PyLink previously used features that were only available in the unreleased Git version.
- The `identify` command now responds with NOTICE instead of PM, behaving like any other command. Thanks to @Techman- for pointing this out.
- The `identify` command must be called in private again.
- Relay now shows secret channels in `linked` to those inside the channel, regardless of whether they're opered.
- `$channel:#channel:prefixmode` exttarget matching no longer raises errors if the target isn't in the specified channel.

##### Internal improvements
- Redone version handling so `__init__.py` isn't committed anymore.
- `update.sh` now passes arguments to the `pylink` launcher.

 - The configuration file is now **pylink.yml** by default, instead of **config.yml**.
 - PyLink now requires installing itself as a module, instead of simply running from source. Do this via `python3 setup.py install --user`.

----

### Changes from 0.9-alpha1

##### Added / changed / removed features
- The `use_experimental_whois` option for InspIRCd servers is removed, and is now implied.
- New config option `bot: whois_show_extensions_to_bots`, which optionally disables extended WHOIS replies for users marked as a bot (+B).
    - This increases security when relay is enabled, for bots that look for services logins in WHOIS.
- Automode has new `clearacc` and `syncacc` commands, for clearing and syncing access lists respectively.
- Relay now allows nick tagging to be turned off by default, via the option `relay: tag_nicks` (#116)
    - This is experimental, and nick tagging is still enabled by default.
    - Any attempts to KILL or SVSNICK a relay client are treated to force tag a nick, so things like `/ns release`, `/ns ghost`, and `/ns regain` should work with network services.
- Automode now only sends one MODE command per sync, to prevent changes from flooding channels.
- Relay separators can now be configured globally (`relay: separator` option), with server-specific overriding that value if given.

##### Bug fixes
- corecommands: fix `unload` failing to remove hooks and commands (0.9.x regression).
- protocols/nefarious: only send EOB_ACK to the direct uplink, preventing stray "acknowledged end of net.burst" messages from showing up. Thanks to Speakz on Evilnet IRC for reporting.
- protocols/unreal: fix server name of the uplink server not being saved (#268)
- Channel prefixes are now sorted in WHOIS output (i.e. no more wrong `@~#channel`), and only the highest prefix shown
- Fixed issues in internal channel mode tracking (c1cd6f4 58d71b0)
- WHOIS requests to the PyLink server for clients that aren't PyLink bots now work (syntax: `/raw whois pylink.server somenick`). "No such nick" errors are also sent when the target is missing, instead of raising warnings. 
    - These WHOIS responses were previously sent from the wrong source (the server that the client was on, instead of the PyLink server), causing them to be ignored if they were going the wrong way.
- Automode now treat channels case insensitively in `delacc`.
- `ascii` and `rfc1459` case mappings now treat Unicode case sensitively, in the same way an IRCd would.

##### Internal improvements
- Removed inaccurate references to signon time in WHOIS and elsewhere.
- Changes to user timestamps are now tracked on NICK and SAVE commands
- Relay now creates relay clones with the current time as nick TS, instead of the origin user's TS.
    - This has the effect of purposely losing nick collisions against local users, so that it's easier to reclaim nicks.

 - Configuration file is now **pylink.yml** by default, instead of **config.yml**.
 - PyLink now requires installing itself as a module, instead of simply running from source. Do this via `python3 setup.py install --user`.

##### Added / changed / removed features
- New **`ctcp`** plugin, handling CTCP VERSION and PING ~~(and perhaps an easter egg?!)~~
- New **`automode`** plugin, implementing basic channel ACL by assigning prefix modes like `+o` to hostmasks and exttargets.
- New exttarget support: see https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/blob/0.9-alpha1/coremods/exttargets.py#L15 for a list of supported ones.
- Relay can now handle messages sent by users not in a target channel (e.g. for channels marked `-n`)
- Relay subserver spawning is now always on - the `spawn_servers` option is removed
- Relay can now optionally show netsplits from remote networks, using a `show_netsplits` option in the `relay:` block
- The `channels` configuration option in `server:` blocks is now optional, and defaults to no channels if not specified 
- The `maxnicklen` configuration option is also now optional, with a default value of 30 characters.
- `--version`, `--no-pid`, and `--help` are now implemented by PyLink's command line script
- Test cases were dropped - they were broken and poorly maintained.
- CPUlimit wrapper scripts were removed.
- Service bots now allow plugins to define service descriptions and mark commands as featured when adding them.
- Command replies for services bots are now consolidated into core. In general, FANTASY commands now reply in channel as PRIVMSG, while all commands sent in PM reply as private notices.
- protocols/inspircd: new `use_experimental_whois` server option, which forces PyLink to handle WHOIS requests locally. This allows relay WHOIS extensions like account name and origin server name (`whois_show_*` options) to actually work on InspIRCd networks.
- PyLink can now optionally protect its services clients by setting servprotect modes (InspIRCd umode `+k`, `+S` elsewhere). The option for this is `protect_services` in the `bot:` block.
- The `networks` now deletes IRC objects when `disconnect` is used. To reconnect all disconnected networks, use the `rehash` command.
- Relay now hides disconnected leaf networks from LINKED output.

##### Bug fixes
- Services bots will now ignore unhandled CTCP requests, instead of responding with "Unknown command"
- The `sid` field for TS6 servers now accepts unquoted numeric SIDs (integers) by normalize the SID to a string
- protocols/nefarious: fix wrong variable in "/join 0" handling causing crashes
- The PyLink bot now rejoins relay channels when it is killed
- protocols/ts6: fix wrong args in TB handling

##### Internal improvements
- `coreplugin.py` is split into `coremods/`, with many different submodules for easier maintenance.
- Rewritten channel TS handling to be more concise and reusable
- protocols/unreal: warn about mode bounces instead of fighting with the uplink
- protocols/ts6, protocols/nefarious: use protocol-specific ban bursting instead of sending a regular MODE
- `Irc.parseModes()` now handles strings given as the mode list properly, instead of only accepting a list of modestring arguments
- `SQUIT` handlers now return an `uplink` field with the SID of the server that the target was split from
- protocols/ts6: send 12 users (SJOIN) and 10 modes (TMODE) per line, instead of 10 and 9 respectively
- Relay is now slightly more careful when normalizing nicks: they can't have invalid characters, start with a hyphen (-), etc.
- Modes are now sorted when joined. You'll now see things like `+Hiow` instead of `+wHoi`
- protocols/inspircd: services clients with mode +k now have the "Network Service" oper type, in WHOIS replies and elsewhere
- SQUIT and KILL handling are moved into a protocols/ircs2s.py module, as the handling is basically the same on both TS6 and P10.
- protocols/nefarious,ts6,unreal: KILL handling (inbound & outbound) now supports kill paths and formats kill reasons properly
- protocols: encapsulated (ENCAP) commands are now implicitly expanded, so protocol modules no longer need to bother with IF statement chains in a `handle_encap()`

# [PyLink 0.6.1-dev](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/0.6.1-dev)
Tagged as **0.6.1-dev** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-03-02T05:15:22Z

* Bug fix release.
    - unreal: fix handing of users connecting via IPv4 3c3ae10
    - ts6: fix incorrect recording of null IPs as 0 instead of 0.0.0.0 fdad7c9
    - inspircd, ts6: don't crash when receiving an unrecognized UID 341c208
    - inspircd: format kill reasons like `Killed (sourcenick (reason))` properly.

# [PyLink 0.6.0-dev](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/0.6.0-dev)
Tagged as **0.6.0-dev** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2016-01-23T18:24:10Z

Notable changes in this release:

- New "opercmds" plugin:
    - This merges some functionality from the bots plugin, but also adds new commands such as `jupe`, `kill`, `topic`, and `checkban`.
- New "changehost" plugin - Automated configurable vHost setting on connect.
- Some core changes will **break** protocol modules and plugins written for older PyLink versions:
    - Some functions have been renamed:
        - `utils.nickToUid(irc, nick)` -> `irc.nickToUid(nick)`
        - `utils.isInternalClient(irc, uid)` -> `irc.isInternalClient(uid)`
        - `utils.isInternalServer(irc, uid)` -> `irc.isInternalServer(uid)`
        - `utils.clientToServer(irc, uid)` -> `utils.getServer(uid)`
        - `utils.getProtoModule(...)` -> `utils.getProtocolModule(...)`
    - Protocol specification is rewritten, with "Client" and "Server" dropped from the suffix of most outgoing commands: see acdd7dbb782765f581...2fd0a8ae741a663d.
- exec plugin: add `inject` and `raw` commands (4e7396b).
- exec plugin: support newline (and other) escapes in `exec` (375dbe8).
- protocols: allow changing remote users' hosts in updateClient (741fed9).
- Speed up and clean up shutdown sequence, fixing hangs due to sockets not shutting down cleanly (#152).
- protocols/unreal: Support cloaking with user mode `+x` (#136).
- Various bug fixes - see https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/compare/0.5-dev...0.6.0-dev for a full diff.

# [PyLink 0.5-dev](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/0.5-dev)
Tagged as **0.5-dev** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2015-12-06T17:54:02Z

The "We're getting somewhere..." release.

### Changes
- *Bug fixes, all the bug fixes*.

#### Core
- Support IPv6 connections in config.
- The offending hook data is now logged whenever a hook function errors, for more convenient debugging.
- Add sanity checks for autoconnect - delay has to be at least 1 second now, to prevent connect floods that go on without any delay in between!
- Add `irc.reply()` to send command replies to callers in the right context (channel or PM).
- More base commands are in `coreplugin` instead of `commands.py` now, making the latter reloadable without restart.
- Don't crash when REHASH loads a config file that's invalid.
- utils: Replace imp (deprecated) with importlib.

#### Plugins
- commands: Add a command to set log level (#124).
- commands: Update `irc.botdata` (`bot:` data in config) in REHASH.
- fantasy: Support nick prefixes (e.g. `PyLink: help`), along with a configurable prefix.

#### Protocols
- protocols/TS6: Fix SQUIT handling and introduction of SID-less servers (i.e. atheme's `/os JUPE`) (#119)
- protocols/unreal: **Add (experimental) support for UnrealIRCd 4.0.x!**
- plugins: More complete INFO logging: plugin loading/unloading, unknown commands called, successful operups

The "prevent PyLink from wrecking my server's CPU" release.

Mostly bug fixes here, with a couple of scripts added (`start-cpulimit.sh` and `kill.sh`) added to assist running PyLink under the protection of [CPUlimit](https://github.com/opsengine/cpulimit). :)

#### New features

- relay: Block most duplicate modes from being relayed (#71)
- main: write a PID file to `pylink.pid` (f85fbd934bb2001122079da9e37e2fd1f9041a18)
- ts6: support `+AOS` charybdis extension modes, warning if the IRCd doesn't support them (146ab5e)

#### Fixes
- relay: quit users who aren't on any shared channels after KICK (71a3464)
- Use RFC1459 for case mapping on InspIRCd (01220b3)
- relay: Fix handling of local `SAVE` (e4da670) and `KILL` (a4da9b5) commands
- relay: fix nick collision loop on `SAVE` + when both tagged (i.e. _42XAAAAAA) and untagged (42XAAAAAA) versions of a UID nick exist (e354ada)
- relay: Fix command arguments of `DELINK` on home networks (c07cfb1)
- relay: `SJOIN` users once, and only once (#71, b681a67)
- main.Irc: catch `OSError` (bad file descriptor) errors and disconnect
- ts6: add QS as a required capability (69e16e5)
- ts6: fix `JOIN` handling and `parse_as` key handling in hooks (ddefd38)
- relay: only wait for `irc.connected` once per network (4d7d7ce)

Tagged as **0.2.2-dev** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2015-07-24T18:09:44Z

The "please don't break again :( " release. 

- Added `WHOIS` handling support for TS6 IRCds.
- ts6: fix handling of `SID`, `CHGHOST`, and `SQUIT` commands.
- Support noctcp (mode `+C`) on charybdis, and wallops (`+w`) in relay.
- Raised fallback ping frequency to 30

...And of course, lots and lots of bug fixes; I won't bother to list them all.

Tagged as **0.2.0-dev** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2015-07-23T04:44:17Z

Many changes in this development release, including:

- **New `ts6` protocol module, for charybdis 3.x.**
- relay: add nick collision handling via `SAVE` (#61).
- relay: trivial tasks like `TOPIC`, `MODE`, `KICK` and `PART` no longer spawn new clients for their senders, and are routed through the pseudoserver when applicable instead (e76d31d c0f8259).
- Irc: be safer against `UnicodeDecodeError` caused by `socket.recv()` cutoff, by decoding each individual line instead (06d17d5).
- relay: make the `nick/net` separator a per-network config option. (ad34f6c).
- relay: Use a whitelist when it comes to relaying modes (#54), and strip out bans that don't match `nick!user@host` syntax (#55).
- relay: Handle user mode changes (#64).
- Support different case mappings for nicknames (RFC1459 vs ASCII) (#75).
- inspircd: remove `RSQUIT` command handler (3494d4f).

And of course, many, many bug fixes! (relay should now work properly with more than 2 networks, for example...)

### Bug fixes and improvements from 0.1.5-dev

- Irc.send: catch `AttributeError` when `self.socket` doesn't exist; i.e. when initial connection fails (b627513)
- Log output to `log/pylink.log`, along with console (#52, 61804b1 fbc2fbf)
- main/coreplugin: use `log.exception()` instead of `traceback.print_exc()`, so logs aren't only printed to screen (536366d)
- relay: don't relay messages sent to the PyLink client (688675d)
- relay: add a `save` command, and make rescheduling optional in `exportDB()` (c00da49)
- utils: add `getHostmask()` (1b09a00)
- various: Log command usage, `exec` usage, successful logins, and access denied errors in `admin.py`'s commands (57e9bf6)

# [PyLink 0.1.5-dev](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/releases/tag/0.1.5-dev)
Tagged as **0.1.5-dev** by [GLolol](https://github.com/GLolol) on 2015-07-18T20:01:39Z

### New features

- Hooks for `CHGHOST`, `CHGIDENT`, and `CHGNAME` (f9d8215 35f1c88)
- IrcUser: Implement user channel tracking via an `IrcUser.channels` attribute (d97fce8)
- Send PING to our uplink periodically, and quit if we don't get a response (#42, #57)
    - New server `pingfreq` option is introduced to set the time between PINGs.
- relay: Only spawn clients if they share a channel, and quit them when they leave all shared channels (cf32461)
- Support autoreconnecting to networks! A new `autoconnect` server setting is added to set autoconnect delay. 
- New `PYLINK_DISCONNECT` hook to keep track of network disconnections (3f6f78b)
- relay: add a `LINKED` command (#65, bbcd70b)
- commands: add a `HELP` command (#8, 6508cb3 4553eda)

### Bug fixes
- relay: don't spawn tagged clones for the internal PyLink client (40fd9e3)
- relay: don't send empty `MODE` commands if there are no supported modes left after filtering (2a586a6)
- protocol/inspircd: don't raise KeyError when removing channel from user fails (73c625a)
- relay: only join PyLink to channels & set topics if there's actually a relay on the network (49943a7)
- relay: fix the wrong modes being propagated to the wrong channels on `LINK` (#53, ccf7596)
- relay: fix "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration" in `handle_part` (d30890c)
- relay: Only allow messaging users in common channels / channels that you're in (#62, 024ac16)

### Misc. changes
- Move client/server spawning, hook calling, command handling, and KILL/KICK detection outside the protocol module (0aa2f98 fdea348)
- Fix fakeirc and tests for relay (#56, a51cfcb)

### Removed features
- commands: remove `debug` command; it's useless now that `exec`, `showchan`, and `showuser` exist (50665ec)
- admin: `tell` command has been removed. Rationale: limited usefulness; doesn't wrap long messages properly. (4553eda)
