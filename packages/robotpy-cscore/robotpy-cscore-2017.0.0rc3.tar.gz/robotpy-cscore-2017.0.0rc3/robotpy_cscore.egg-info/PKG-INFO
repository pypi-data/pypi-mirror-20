Description: robotpy-cscore
        ==============
        
        These are python bindings for the cscore library, which is a high performance 
        library used in the FIRST Robotics competition to serve video to/from robots.
        However, the core library is suitable for use in other applications, and is
        comparable to something like mjpg-streamer.
        
        This library has only been tested with Python 3, and will most likely not work
        with Python 2.7. We do not intend to support using Python 2.7.
        
        .. note:: This is currently a preview release, a stable release with precompiled
                  binaries and the like will be available at the end of January. Please
                  try this out, file bugs, and make pull requests!
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        The cscore library currently only supports USB cameras on Linux. On other
        platforms you will want to use OpenCV to open a VideoCamera object. You can
        check at runtime to see if cscore is compiled with USB camera support by
        checking for the presence of a 'UsbCamera' class. If it's not there, it's
        not supported.
        
        See the `cvstream.py` example for using OpenCV in this manner.
        
        Quick usage
        ===========
        
        The following will launch a USB Webcam server locally that can be queried via
        NetworkTables::
        
            python3 -m cscore
        
        RoboRIO usage
        =============
        
        TODO
        
        Compilation
        ===========
        
        Currently, this isn't setup to work on Windows. It might work on Windows though,
        I haven't tried it yet.
        
        Important: You MUST compile OpenCV with shared libraries (the default), if your
        python cv2 is statically linked this will most likely not work with it (if you
        do get such a setup working , please let me know!).
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Python 3.x
        * OpenCV 3.x
        * NumPy
        * pybind11
        
        You should be able to install numpy and pybind11 via pip:
        
            pip3 install numpy pybind11
            
        You cannot use opencv-python at this time (see notes below), you will need to
        compile it from source yourself.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Once you get OpenCV and NumPy installed, then you should be able to do a::
            
            pip3 install --pre robotpy-cscore
            
        If you're installing from the source in this repository, you will need to do:
        
            git clone https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-cscore.git
            cd robotpy-cscore
            git submodule init
            git submodule update
            pip3 install .
            
        Notes
        =====
        
        Long term, I'd like to get this working with opencv-python. However, that's
        going to take a bit of work. To track the primary problem related to this, see
        https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python/issues/22
