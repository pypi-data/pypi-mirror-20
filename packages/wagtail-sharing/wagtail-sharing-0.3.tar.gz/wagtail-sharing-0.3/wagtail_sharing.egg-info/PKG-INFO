        wagtail-sharing
        ===============
        
        Easier sharing of `Wagtail <https://wagtail.io>`__ drafts.
        
        Wagtail Sharing makes it easier to share Wagtail draft content for
        review by users who don't have access to the Wagtail admin site. It
        allows you to define an alternate hostname and/or port on which to
        expose the latest revision of all of your Wagtail pages.
        
        For example, let's say your Wagtail site is running on
        http://mysite.com. You've created a draft page at slug
        ``/path/to/draft``, but haven't yet published it. Wagtail Sharing lets
        you expose that draft page at some other domain, for example
        http://sharing.mysite.com/path/to/draft.
        
        In another use case, you might have a published page at
        http://mysite.com/already/published/page, and you've made some draft
        changes. Wagtail Sharing lets you expose those draft changes at
        http://sharing.mysite.com/already/published/page while still keeping the
        same published content at your regular domain.
        
        These examples obviously work best when you have some method of
        restricting access to http://sharing.mysite.com, for example by only
        exposing that subdomain on a private network.
        
        Wagtail Sharing lets you create separate sharing sites for each Wagtail
        Site you have defined. It also supports a configurable visual banner on
        shared pages to remind reviewers that content may differ from your
        published site.
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        1. Install the package using pip:
        
        ``sh  pip install git+https://github.com/cfpb/wagtail-sharing.git``
        
        1. Add ``wagtailsharing`` as an installed app in your Django settings:
        
        ``py  # in settings.py  INSTALLED_APPS = (      ...      'wagtailsharing',      ...  )``
        
        1. Run migrations to create required database tables:
        
        ``sh  $ manage.py migrate wagtailsharing``
        
        1. Replace use of Wagtail's catch-all URL pattern:
        
        \`\`\`diff # in urls.py -from wagtail.wagtailcore import urls as
        wagtail\_urls +from wagtailsharing import urls as wagtailsharing\_urls
        
        ...
        
        -urlpatterns.append(url(r'', include(wagtail\_urls)))
        +urlpatterns.append(url(r'', include(wagtailsharing\_urls))) \`\`\`
        
        Sharing sites
        -------------
        
        The Wagtail admin now contains a new section under Settings called
        Sharing Sites that allows users to define how they would like to expose
        latest page revisions.
        
        .. figure:: docs/images/sharing-sites.png
           :alt: Sharing sites
        
           Sharing sites
        
        No sharing sites exist by default. A sharing site must be manually
        created for each Wagtail Site to make its latest revisions shareable.
        Each sharing site is defined by a unique hostname and port number.
        **Important: configuring your sharing sites improperly could expose
        draft/private content publicly. Be careful when setting them up!**
        
        Banners
        -------
        
        Pages viewed on a wagtail-sharing shared site have a simple banner added
        to them to remind reviewers that the current published content may
        differ from the content they are viewing.
        
        .. figure:: docs/images/banner.png
           :alt: Banner
        
           Banner
        
        This behavior can be disabled by setting
        ``settings.WAGTAILSHARING_BANNER = False``. The banner template can be
        overridden by providing an alternate template file at
        ``wagtailsharing/banner.html`` similar to how `wagtailadmin template
        overrides <http://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/advanced_topics/customisation/admin_templates.html#customising-admin-templates>`__
        are supported.
        
        Sharing links
        -------------
        
        A page's sharing URL can be retrieved by passing its ``Page`` instance
        to ``wagtailsharing.helpers.get_sharing_url``. This method returns
        ``None`` if no shared sites are configured or if the specified page is
        not routable to a shared site.
        
        Shared pages will also have a new dropdown menu option that links to
        this sharing URL from the Wagtail page explorer.
