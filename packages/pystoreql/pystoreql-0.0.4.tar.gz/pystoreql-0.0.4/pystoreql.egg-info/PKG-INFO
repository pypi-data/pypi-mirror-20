Description: pystoreql: A command line tool to easily share pastes and files.
        ================================================================
        
        1. Why ``pystoreql``?:
        ======================
        
        ``pystoreql`` (*py-store-q-l*) lets you share pastes, files and directories easily and let you choose the name (``id``) (could be easy to be remembered) for the paste/file/directory being shared. Everyone who has the ``id`` can download the paste/file/directory easily by typing a simple command (e.g., ``pystoreql get <id>``) without opening a web browser. Read more below to find out how to use ``pystoreql``.
        
        Features:
        ---------
        
        * Anonymous sharing: No need to register to post, upload, download.
        * Easy to use: Simply typing a command v.s. opening a web browser or using a graphic interface clients.
        * Unlimited: In theory, there should be no limit on the number and the size of pastes or files you can share.
        * Possible to host and use your own ``pystoreql`` server with the same command line interface like ``git``.
        * More features will be coming as users suggest.
        
        To do:
        ------
        
        * Writing tests
        * Web interface (maybe)
        * Better support for Windows and MacOS. 
        * Phone applications i.e., Android, iOS, ... (unlikely)
        
        2. Paste sharing:
        =================
        
        The two main sub-commands for paste sharing are ``post`` and ``get``. To share a paste and assign it an ``id`` (e.g., ``your_wanted_id``)::
        
          $ pystoreql post your_wanted_id "the paste string"
        
        or::
        
          $ cat your_file.txt > pystoreql post your_wanted_id
        
        To retrieve a paste with a given ``id`` (e.g., ``the_id``)::
        
          $ pystoreql get the_id
        
        To retrieve a paste with a given id (e.g., ``the_id``) and save it to a file (e.g., ``filename.txt``) ::
        
          $ pystoreql get the_id > filename.txt  
        
        
        3. File and directory sharing:
        ==============================
        
        The two main sub-commands for file and directory sharing are ``push`` and ``pull``. To share a file or a directory and assign it an ``id`` (e.g., ``your_wanted_id``)::
        
          $ pystoreql push your_wanted_id the_file_or_dir_path
        
        To retrieve a file or a directory with a given ``id`` (e.g., ``the_id``) to the current working directory::
        
          $ pystoreql pull the_id
        
        4. Command line interface:
        ==========================
        
        ::
        
          $ pystoreql --help
          Usage:
            pystoreql get <id>
            pystoreql post <id> <value>
            pystoreql pull <id>
            pystoreql push <id> <file_or_dir>
