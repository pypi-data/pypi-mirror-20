        ==========
        
        *A skeleton command line program in Python.*
        
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To authenticate with AWS (the AWS credential file is normally located at ~/.aws/credentials):
        
            micros authenticate <cred-file> <aws_key> <aws_secret>
        
        Create a new project:
        
            micros create <project>
        
        Deploy your files to S3:
        
            micros deploy <project> <directory> [--create_www] [--create_hosted]
            
        Run the project locally (use this command in the root of your project):
        
            micros run <port>
            
        Delete the static website and remove all files (permanent):
        
            micros delete <project>
        
        Show help dialog:
        
            micros --help
        
        Show current version:
        
            micros --version
        
        
        Options:
            
            --help                         Show this screen.
            --version                      Show version.
            --create_www                   Create a second S3 bucket with prepended 'www.' which redirects to the default
            --create_host                  Create hosted Route 53 zone on AWS
        
        Examples:
        
            micros authenticate ~/.aws/credentials 76231 18290
            micros create festive_season
            micros run 8080
            micros deploy festive_season local/directory/
            micros delete festive_season
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install dependencies:
            
            pip install -e .[test]
        
        Run tests:
            
            python setup.py test
        
        This will trigger `py.test <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_, along with its popular
        `coverage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov>`_ plugin.
        
        Build:
            
            python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
            twine upload dist/*
        
        This will build both a source tarball of your CLI tool, as well as a newer wheel
        build (*and this will, by default, run on all platforms*).
        
        The ``twine upload`` command (which requires you to install the `twine
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_ tool) will then securely upload your
        new package to PyPI so everyone in the world can use it!
