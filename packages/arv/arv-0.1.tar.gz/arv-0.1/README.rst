arv â€” a fast 23andMe parser for Python
======================================

Arv (Norwegian; "inheritance" or "heritage") is a Python module for parsing raw
23andMe genome files. It lets you lookup SNPs from RSIDs.

.. code:: python

  from arv import load, unphased_match as match

  genome = load("genome.txt")

  print("You are a {gender} with {color} eyes and {complexion} skin.".format(
    gender     = "man" if genome.y_chromosome else "woman",
    complexion = "light" if genome["rs1426654"] == "AA" else "dark",
    eyecolor   = match(genome["rs12913832"], {"AA": "brown",
                                              "AG": "brown or green",
                                              "GG": "blue"})))

In my case, this little program produces::

    You are a man with blue eyes and light skin.

It's insanely fast: On a 2013 Xeon machine, a 24 Mb file is fully parsed and
put into a hash table in less than 70 ms. Its guts are written in finely tuned
C++ and is exposed to Python via Cython.

Status
======

> This project is currently just a work in progress! I intend to wrap
dna-traits under a new name, using Cython to interface with dna-traits much
more easily.  For a working (but old) version, see
https://github.com/cslarsen/dna-traits

Installation
============

The recommended way is to install from PyPi.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install arv

**NOTE: PyPi/pip is not yet available!**

In the meantime, you can do

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py install
