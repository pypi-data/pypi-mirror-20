scicast is a python utility that automates many of the repetitive steps of analyzing single cell sequencing data.

-k-means clustering to identify clusters

-Clustering and subclustering of data to identify 'stable' sets of cells.

-Statistical testing to identify top genes that indentify stable cluster.

-Correlation search and analysis to identify gene networks driving cluster identity.

-Outputs both plots for visualization (PCA and heatmap) cell and gene lists that can be used to refine analysis.
