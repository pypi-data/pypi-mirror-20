        Hello!
        
        Thanks for installing TypToP (version: 0.2.2).  This software
        attaches a new pluggable authentication module (PAM) to some of your
        common authentication processes, such as su, login, screensaver etc.,
        and observes for password typing mistakes. It records your frequent
        typing mistakes, and enable logging in with slight vairations of your
        actual login password that are frequent and safe to do so.
        
        This is a research prototype, and we are collecting some anonymous
        non-sensitive data about your password typing patterns to verify our
        design. The details of what we collect, how we collect and store, and
        the security blueprint of this software can be found in the GitHub
        page: https://github.com/rchatterjee/pam-typopw.  The participation in the study is completely voluntary,
        and you can opt out at any time while still keep using the software.
        
        Checkout other options (such as opting out of the study) of the
        utility script typtop by running:
        
        $ typtops.py --help
        
        Note, You have to initiate this for each user who intend to use the
        benefit of adaptive typo-tolerant password login.
