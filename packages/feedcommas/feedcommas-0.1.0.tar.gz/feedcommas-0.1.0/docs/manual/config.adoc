[[config]]
== Configuration

Feed Commas can be configured by setting several options in a standard
{ini-wiki-url}[ini-style] configuration file. The file
is searched in a filesystem in a way described by {basedir-url}[XDG Base
Directory Specification]. In practice it means that for most users it will be
located in `~/.config/feed-commas/config.ini`. However, any of below files can
be read if the none of the previous ones was found:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feed-commas/config.ini`. If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set,
   it defaults to `$HOME/.config`.
2. any of `$XDG_DATA_DIRS/feed-commas/config.ini`. `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` is
   colon-separated list of directories to check. If it is not set, it defaults
   to `/etc/xdg`.

If configuration file is not found, Feed Commas will create one with default
parameters filled in a first suitable directory
(`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feed-commas`).

Before Feed Commas terminates, previously read configuration file is saved back
to a filesystem.

=== Structure

INI files are made up of sections, and so is the one Feed Commas uses. Below is
example (but not complete) of file, which has `[server]` and `[keys]` sections.

----
[server]
address = https://commafeed.com
workers = 2

[keys]
nav-up = k
nav-down = j
----

[[cfg-server]]
==== Server

`[server]` contains options for configuring access to CommaFeed server.

[cols="2*^m,4", options="header"]
.Available options for [server] section
|===
| Option | Default value | Description

| address
| \https://commafeed.com
| Address of CommaFeed instance with which Feed Commas will communicate.

| username
|
| name used to login to CommaFeed instance.

| password
|
| Plain text password which will be used to login to CommaFeed. Due to security
  reasons, *it is not recommended leave passwords as plain text* in any
  configuration file. Use *password-cmd* instead, which will dynamically get
  needed password.

| password-cmd
|
| A command used to get password to login to CommaFeed. It takes precedence over
  *password*, even if the latter is set.

| workers
| 2
| Number of worker processes used to communicate with CommaFeed. If it is unset,
  workers will be spawned in a number equal to available CPU cores.
|===

[[cfg-keys]]
==== Keys

`[keys]` contains key mappings used in Feed Commas.

[cols="^2m,^1m,6", options="header"]
.Available options for [keys] section
|===
| Option | Default value | Description

| [[navigation]]nav-up
| kbd:[k]
| Navigates and scrolls up. It is used e.g. to navigate a menu and scroll
  article list.

| nav-down
| kbd:[j]
| Navigates and scrolls down. It is used e.g. to navigate a menu and scroll
  article list.

| nav-right
| kbd:[l]
| Navigates right. It is used e.g. to switch used panel from menu to article
  list.

| nav-right
| kbd:[h]
| Navigates right. It is used e.g. to switch used panel from article list to
  menu.

| [[toggle-read]]toggle-read
| kbd:[r]
| Toggles between read and unread state for currently selected article.

| toggle-star
| kbd:[s]
| Stars or unstars currently selected article.

| show-all
|
| Shows both unread and read entries.

| show-unread
|
| Shows only unread entries.

| refresh
| kbd:[F5]
| Refreshes list of articles. Also clears a cache.

| sync
|
| Downloads all feeds and categories for offline read. Only works if cache if
  `<<cache-time,cache-time>>` is enabled (i.e. is set to non-negative value).

| open-browser
| kbd:[ctrl+\]]
| Opens selected article in a default web browser.  Refer to the documentation
  of your Operating System how to configure one. Usually setting `$BROWSER`
  environment variable should be sufficient.

| quit
| kbd:[q]
| Quits Feed Commas.
|===

Key values can contain modifiers, but they heavily depend on what keycodes
terminal sends. For example, terminals usually won't explicitly send
kbd:[shift], but uppercase letters instead (so instead of mapping kbd:[shift+e],
map kbd:[E]).

Any combination of kbd:[ctrl] and kbd:[alt] modifiers is available as `c-` and
`a-` prefixes. Other keys are also available:

[.center, width=50%, cols="^,^m", options="header"]
.Special keys

| kbd:[ctrl+alt+←]  | c-a-left
| kbd:[alt+Enter]   | a-enter
|===

WARNING: Non-character keys should be written lower-case! Instead of typing `F5`,
type `f5`, `page down`, `enter` and so on.

==== Settings

`[settings]` section contains options affecting various behaviours of
Feed Commas.

[cols="^2m,^1m,6", options="header"]
.Available options for [settings] section
|===
| Option | Default value | Description

| mark-read-time
| 2
| Time (in seconds) after which currently selected article will be marked as
  read. If set to 0, articles will be marked as read immediately. If set to
  -1, articles won't be automatically marked as read.

  Usually it's advised to be kept as positive integer, which will prevent
  marking articles as unread when scrolling through an article list.

| show-read
| false
| If set to _true_, all articles will be shown on the article list. If set to
  _false_, only unread articles will be shown. Using
  `<<toggle-read,toggle-read>>` automatically changes this setting so after
  application restart, the last state is used.

| supported-colors
| 256
| Number of colors supported by terminal. Most terminals nowdays support at
  least 256 colors, so if things work for you, don't change this setting.

  Valid values: 1, 16, 88, 256

| bright-bold
| false
| Display bright colors as bold (some terminals work that way). Change it to
  true if you don't see a difference when using bright colors.

| html-filter
| builtin
a| Method of filtering HTML in received entries so they're readable. Can be
   either of the following:

   * `builtin` - simple (and inaccurate) builtin filtering method. Quite fast
     and doesn't need any additional dependencies.
   * `none` or unset option - filtering is disabled and HTML is printed exactly
     as received
   * any filter command - external command, which accepts HTML on its stdin and
     converts it to a readable output on its stdout. Some text-based browsers
     (http://lynx.browser.org/[lynx], http://elinks.or.cz/[elinks]) support such
     mode. Make sure to read a <<html-filter-tip,tip about commands>> if you
     want to use this option.

| [[cache-time]]cache-time
| 0
| Time (in minutes) for which each request to CommaFeed will be cached. If not
  set or set to 0, caching is disabled.
|===

[[html-filter-tip]]
[TIP]
.html-filter commands usage
====
Both lynx and elinks work very well as `html-filter`. Keep in mind however that
they can slow down obtaining entries a little because an external process must
be started separately for each entry.

The best results are achieved when they are configured with a dump wide enough,
so that Feed Commas can take care of line wrapping:

----
html-filter = elinks -dump -dump-width 500
html-filter = lynx -dump -width 500 -stdin
----
====

==== Colors

Different parts of Feed Commas can be colorized to your liking by setting
different options in `[colors]` section. Default values are sensible, but the
end-result depends on terminal's color capabilities. Color can be empty, in
which case

[cols="^2m,^1m,6", options="header"]

| article-border-focus
| light blue
| Color of currently selected article's border.

| metadata
| light gray
| Various meta data information: article's publication date, article's header,
  various indicators on articles list, number of unread articles in menu etc.

| menu-focus-fg
| white
| Foreground color of currently selected menu item.

| menu-focus-bg

|===

Monochrome, 16-, 88- and 256-color terminals are supported. As a color name you
can use any of standard color values: _black, dark red, dark green, brown,
dark blue, dark magenta, dark cyan, light gray, dark gray, light
red, light green, yellow, light blue, light magenta, light cyan,
white_. For terminals which support that, you can also use other notations:

* `#fcc`: hex like HTML color;
* `g40`: decimal value: 40% of gray
* `g#cc`: hex value: 80% of gray
* `h255`: color number 255

For different terminals colors are configured in different ways, but most often
they're defined in `~/.Xresources` file. Consult your terminal's documentation
for details.

Apart from color name, you can specify some text attributes, which should be
placed after comma. These attributes include _bold, underline, blink_ and
_standout_. Color value can be omitted, in which case a default foreground or
background color for your terminal will be used.

[.center, cols="^1m,3", options="header"]
.Color setting examples
|===
| Setting   | Description
| dark gray | Set color to "dark gray" standard color.
| #f00,bold | Set font to bold red.
| bold      | Set font to bold. Default color will be used (depending on which
              option is set)
