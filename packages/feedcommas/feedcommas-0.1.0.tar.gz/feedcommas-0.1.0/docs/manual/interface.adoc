 ▲ Commandline / message display
----

Above is example view of Feed Commas, drawn to fit 80 characters wide terminal.
Interface resizes dynamically, so on modern displays you'll encounter more free
space.

Its two main parts are menu with subscribed feeds and categories on the left,
and article list on the right. Feed Commas starts with a focus on article list.
To switch between menu and article list, use kbd:[h] and kbd:[l] by default (see
<<navigation,navigation>> part of configuration). To scroll menu and article
list, use by default kbd:[j] and kbd:[k].

There's also a command line on the bottom of the screen. It's accessible after
pressing kbd:[:] key. To close it, press kbd:[Esc] or delete the whole typed
text. To show completion hints press kbd:[Tab] during typing a command.

Command line is also shared for a display of messages from Feed Commas (like
errors encountered when communicating with CommaFeed, synchronization progress
etc.). If commandline is active (i.e. command is being typed in), messages are
displayed aisde of it.

[NOTE]
.Configuration
====
Before you'll be able to actually use Feed Commas, you need to at least
configure credentials used to log into CommaFeed. See <<config>> and
<<cfg-server,server>> sections in particular for details.

=== Commands

Most of commands are bound to some key by default, but not all of them. All of
them, however, are available to by used in a Commandline. All commands, beside
navigation ones (`nav-up`, `nav-down`, `nav-right` and `nav-left`) are
available. For a complete list, see <<cfg-keys,keys>> subsection.

You don't have to type the whole command. If only one command starts with a
typed string, a correct command will be executed. No command is executed in case
of ambiguity. For example, `:q` will work the same as `:quit`, but `:toggle`
won't run anything because there are two possible commands: `toggle-read` and
`toggle-star`.
