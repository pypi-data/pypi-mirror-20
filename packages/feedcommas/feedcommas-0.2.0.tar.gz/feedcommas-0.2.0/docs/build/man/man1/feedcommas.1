.sp
The following parameters can be passed to Feed Commas when it\(cqs started:
.SS "General options"
.sp
\fB\-c, \-\-config\fP=\fICONFIG_FILE\fP
.RS 4
Use a \fICONFIG_FILE\fP as Feed Commas\(aq configuration file. This file is used
instead of the one which would be normally found by a default configuration
search. If \fICONFIG_FILE\fP doesn\(cqt exists, it is created.
.sp
Feed Commas reports if \fICONFIG_FILE\fP is incorrect somehow or if it couldn\(cqt be
created and quits in that case.
.RE
.SS "Program information"
.sp
\fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Prints a short summary of available program options and quits.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Prints a version of Feed Commas and quits.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
Feed Commas can be configured by setting several options in a standard
.URL "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file" "ini\-style" " "
configuration file. If not specified via \f[CR]\-c,
\-\-config\fP flag, the file is searched in a filesystem in a way described by
.URL "https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir\-spec/basedir\-spec\-latest.html" "XDG Base Directory Specification" "."
In practice it means that for
most users it will be located in \f[CR]~/.config/feed\-commas/config.ini\fP. However,
any of below files can be read if the none of the previous ones was found:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
\f[CR]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feed\-commas/config.ini\fP. If \f[CR]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is not set,
it defaults to \f[CR]$HOME/.config\fP.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
any of \f[CR]$XDG_DATA_DIRS/feed\-commas/config.ini\fP. \f[CR]$XDG_DATA_DIRS\fP is
colon\-separated list of directories to check. If it is not set, it defaults
to \f[CR]/etc/xdg\fP.
.RE
.sp
If configuration file is not found, Feed Commas will create one with default
parameters filled in a first suitable directory
(\f[CR]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feed\-commas\fP).
.sp
Before Feed Commas terminates, previously read configuration file is saved back
to a filesystem.

.sp
You can tell Feed Commas to use a specific configuration file by using \f[CR]\-c,
\-\-config\fP switch. Feed Commas will read it (or create it if it doesn\(cqt exist)
and everything else will work the same as with configuration found by above
method.
