Description: # simplicial
        
        Simplicial topology in Python.
        
        This package arose from explorations of using ideas from algebraic
        topology in the context of wireless sensor networks, to tackle
        problems like target tracking and estimation of the goodness-of-fit of
        interpolations from isolated observations. Its main contribution is to
        represent and manipulate simplicial complexes, topological structures
        describing spaces built from cells.
