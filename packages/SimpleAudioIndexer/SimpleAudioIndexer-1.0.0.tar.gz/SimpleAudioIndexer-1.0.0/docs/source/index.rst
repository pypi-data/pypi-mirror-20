Simple Audio Indexer, (or `sai`_, to be shorter!) is a Python library and
command-line tool that enables one to search for a word or a phrase within an
audio file.

Based on that simple core, it generalizes the searching process and lets one
to search for multiple queries within multiple audio files of any size.

It also provides advanced searching abilities by allowing the developer to
either use the currently implemented control structures on the search methods,
or for the developer to define her own patterns in regex and match them to
contents of the audio file.

`sai`_ is open-source, licensed under `Apache v2.0 <https://github.com/aalireza/SimpleAudioIndexer/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.
