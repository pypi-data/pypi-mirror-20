McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) DXL Python Client Library
===========================================================

Overview
--------

The `McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator <https://www.mcafee.com/us/products/epolicy-orchestrator.aspx>`_ (ePO) DXL Python
client library provides a high level wrapper for invoking ePO remote commands via the
`Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_ (DXL) fabric.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to invoke ePO remote commands without having to focus
on lower-level details such as ePO-specific DXL topics and message formats.

This client requires an ePO DXL service to be running and available on the DXL fabric.

A Python-based implementation of an ePO DXL service is available here:
