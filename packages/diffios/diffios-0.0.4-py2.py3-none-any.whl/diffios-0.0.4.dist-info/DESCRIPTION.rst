diffios is a Python library that compares Cisco IOS configurations, outputting
the lines of configuration which are additional and which are missing. It
respects the hierarchical nature of Cisco IOS configurations, uses variables
for elements that are expected to differ per config, such as ip addresses, and
can ignore junk lines. Its goal is to make the compliance auditing of large
network estates more manageable.
