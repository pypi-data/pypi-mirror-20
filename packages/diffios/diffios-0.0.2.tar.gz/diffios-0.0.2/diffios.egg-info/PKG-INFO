        diffios is a Python library that compares Cisco IOS configurations, outputting
        the lines of configuration which are additional and which are missing. It
        respects the hierarchical nature of Cisco IOS configurations, uses variables
        for elements that are expected to differ per config, such as ip addresses, and
        can ignore junk lines. Its goal is to make the compliance auditing of large
        network estates more manageable.
