Configuration examples
======================

These configuration examples can serve as a starting point for your own configuration file.

The examples include a configuration ``.json`` file, an input ``.bib`` or ``.bbl`` file, an input ``.tex`` file, and an output ``.tex`` file. The output is how the LaTeX markup looks after the citation commands have been replaced with written-out references by `latexdiffcite`. The examples are verified by the testing suite and should work.
