Green
=====

Green is a clean, colorful, fast python test runner.

Documentation
-------------

Please visit the `GitHub page for Green`_ for full documentation, including a
nice `tutorial on how to correctly layout unit tests`_ in your own python
project.


Features
--------

- **Clean** - Low redundancy in output. Result stats for each test is lined up in a vertical column.
- **Colorful** - Terminal output makes good use of color when the terminal supports it.
- **Fast** - Tests run in independent processes.  (One per processor by default.  Does not play nicely with gevent.)
- **Powerful** - Multi-target + auto-discovery.
- **Traditional** - Use the normal ``unittest`` classes and methods for your unit tests.
- **Descriptive** - Four verbosity levels, from just dots to full docstring output.
- **Convenient** - Bash-completion and ZSH-completion of options and test targets.
- **Thorough** - Built-in, optional integration with `coverage`_
- **Modern** - Supports Python 2.7, 3.4+, and `PyPy`_
- **Portable** - Completely supports OS X, Linux, and BSDs (and Windows on Python 2.7 and mostly on 3.4+)
- **Living** - This project grows and changes.  See the `changelog`_
