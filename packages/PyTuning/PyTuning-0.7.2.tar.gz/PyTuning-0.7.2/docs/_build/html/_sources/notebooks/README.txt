Jupyter Notebooks
=================

This directory contains some samples of interactive analysis conducted
in the `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`__ environment. Github does
a passable job of rendering these, so you can see what's possible
without going through the formality of actually installing the software.

For complex analysis I would encourage you to explore this environment.

Please see the documentation for notes on installing the Jupyter stack.

A note on equations: Github renders equations to graphics, whereas the
live notebooks will use javascript to render via MathJax. For large equations
(such as long scales), the legibility on the live notebook is much better.
