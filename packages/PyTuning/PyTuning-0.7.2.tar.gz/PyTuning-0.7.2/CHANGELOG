Version:    0.7.2

    Something of a check-point release. Nothing too earth-shattering,
    but there hasn't been much done on the code lately, so I wanted
    to include what's been laying around for a few months.

    * Added the ability to change the reference frequency of the
      tuning tables, so that one isn't limited to the 12-EDO standard
      for the mapping.
    * New functions:
      * `prime_factor_ratio()`
      * `create_ratio_from_primes()`

Date:       2 December 2016
Version:    0.7.1

    * Corrections to typos in the documentation.
    * Change to sphinx so that autofunction is supported on readthedocs.io.

Date:       1 December 2016
Version:    0.7.0

    * Initial Public Release.
