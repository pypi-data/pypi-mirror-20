# Pip requirements file for development dependencies.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# Sphinx:
# Note: The ordereddict package is a backport of collections.OrderedDict

# PyLint:
# Astroid is used by Pylint. Astroid 1.3 and above, and Pylint 1.4
# and above no longer work with Python 2.6, and have been removed
# from Pypi in 2/2016 after being available for some time.
# Therefore, we cannot use Pylint under Python 2.6.
# Also, Pylint does not support Python 3.
