Description: Bear Installation Tool
        ======================
        
        coala features a Bear Installation Tool that helps installing bears one by one
        or all of them. This tool is helpful as it also manages to install the bears'
        external dependencies.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install the tool, simply run:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip3 install cib
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        
        To use the tool, you need to give it arguments.
        
        To install bears, simply run ``cib install`` followed by names of bears,
        or by ``all``. Therefore:
        
        ::
        
            $ cib install all
        
        will install all the available bears, whereas
        
        ::
        
            $ cib install CPPCheckBear PEP8Bear
        
        will install the specified bears only.
        ``cib uninstall`` works exactly the same way as ``cib install``.
        
        To see the full list of available bears, run
        
        ::
        
            $ cib list
        
        To upgrade the already installed bears, run
        
        ::
        
            $ cib upgrade all
        
        to upgrade all installed bears, or
        
        ::
        
            $ cib upgrade CPPCheckBear PEP8Bear
        
        to upgrade the specified bears. However, if they are not installed, they will
        not be upgraded.
        
        To check whether a bear meets all its dependencies, use
        
        ::
        
            $ cib check-deps all
        
        This will ensure all the installed bears have met their dependencies.
        
        For more information, run
        
        ::
        
            $ cib help
