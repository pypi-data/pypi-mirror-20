Reference implementation for Quickshear Defacing
Tested with T1-weighted NIFTI files

Requires:
NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
NiBabel (http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nibabel/)

Usage: quickshear.py anat_file strip_file defaced_file [buffer]
anat_file: Image to be defaced
strip_file: Skull stripped image
defaced_file: Desired output filename
buffer: Optional buffer between shear plane and brain mask, default is 10

Quickshear uses a skull stripped version of an anatomical as a reference
to deface the full version of that anatomy.  This program has been tested with
.nii files and may or may not work with other NiBabel compatible formats.
