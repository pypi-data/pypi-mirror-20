Description: Reference implementation for Quickshear Defacing
        Tested with T1-weighted NIFTI files
        
        Requires:
        NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
        NiBabel (http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nibabel/)
        
        Usage: quickshear.py anat_file strip_file defaced_file [buffer]
        anat_file: Image to be defaced
        strip_file: Skull stripped image
        defaced_file: Desired output filename
        buffer: Optional buffer between shear plane and brain mask, default is 10
        
        Quickshear uses a skull stripped version of an anatomical as a reference
        to deface the full version of that anatomy.  This program has been tested with
        .nii files and may or may not work with other NiBabel compatible formats.
