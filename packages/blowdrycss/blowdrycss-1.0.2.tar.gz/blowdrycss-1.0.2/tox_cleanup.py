""" Cleans the project root directory before running tox tests.

Specifically, removes blowdrycss_settings.py from the project root before and after tox testing is finished.
The settings file is auto-generated as part of the integration testing.

If the settings file is in the root folder the py33+ could fail if the settings files changed. It is a strange
corner case that took a while to figure out since the python3 import system is different that py27.

Reproducing the error (scenario 1):
Go to project root where setup.py resides.
Activate virtual environment
Run: tox
If certain tests fail blowdrycss_settings.py could now be in the root directory.
Now subsequent py3x tests will fail.

Reproducing the error (scenario 2):
Go to project root where setup.py resides.
Activate virtual environment
Run: python setup.py install
blowdrycss_settings.py is now in the root directory.
Modify blowdrycss/blowdrycss/blowdrycss_settings.py
Run: tox
py3x tests will fail.
