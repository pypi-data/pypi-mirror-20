      allow for the dynamic creation of media queries. (1/2/2016)
    |
    | **0.0.7** -- ALPHA release: Implemented backward compatibility with Python version 2.7.x.
    |
    | **0.0.8** -- Major refactoring of directory structure, and preparation of new settings file.
    |
    | **0.0.9** -- This version auto-builds blowdrycss_settings.py inside of the users web project making the settings
      easier to find and edit.
    |
    | **0.1.0** -- BETA release: Fixed ImportErrors when running blowdrycss after
      ``pip install blowdrycss`` or ``python setup.py install``. Entered BETA.
    |
    | **0.1.1** -- Corrected more errors in the import infrastructure. Fixed ``blowdrycss_settings.py`` so that
      settings can be customized.
    |
    | **0.1.2** -- ``HTML, JINJA, .NET, and RUBY Template`` file types are now supported. Meaning that classes can be
      discovered in them. To use open ``blowdrycss_settings.py`` and set ``file_types = ('*.html', '.<extension>')``.
      See ``blowdrycss.classparser`` for more details about available extensions.
    |
    | **Supported jinja and django template extensions:** ::

        .jinja, .jinja2, .jnj, .ja, .djt, .djhtml

    | **Supported XHTML, asp.net, and ruby template extensions:** ::

        .aspx, .ascx, .master, .erb

    | **0.1.3** -- Implemented support for auto-generated CSS via Watchdog. Watchdog can now monitor all files
      associated with the ``file_types`` defined in ``blowdrycss_settings.py``. If a file is modified or deleted,
      Watchdog will trigger blowdrycss and auto-generate the CSS files. Watchdog is now a required dependency.
      The setting ``auto-generate`` is currently ``False`` by default.
    |
    | *To enable it* open ``blowdrycss_settings.py``, and set ``auto_generate = True``.
    | *To test it* change one of the project files, and see what happens at the console.
    |
    | ``Timing.py`` was completely re-written and now contains a ``Timer`` class. These changes were needed to
      accommodate watchdog feature.
    |
    | CSS file size reduction statistics are now printed.
    |
    | An ASCII blow dryer is now printed on program exit.
    |
    | **0.1.4** -- Dropped support for py30, py31, and py32. Integrated tox to support testing of py27, py33, py34, and
      py35 environments. Fixed unicode issues that caused tests to fail with py27.
    |
    | **0.1.5** -- Upload corrupted on pypi. Everything worked fine on testpypi, but when uploaded to pypi something
      went wrong. (Do not use.)
    |
    | **0.1.6** -- Integrated debug level logging settings. Fixed a logic error in tox_cleanup.py. Compressed
      some of the user feedback. Created a new utility method make_directory().
    |
    | **0.1.7** -- Fancy new favicons. Documentation improved. Official site launched
      `www.blowdrycss.org <http://www.blowdrycss.org>`__. Added the ability parse javascript and typescript files for
      class selectors. Fix a logic error that prevented logging enabled when auto_generate is False.
    |
    | **0.1.8** -- Enable the creation of custom breakpoints e.g. padding--25--820--up, display--480--down,
      margin--5--2--5--2--1000--up, display--960--up--i, display--3_2rem--down.  Class parser now allows for
      CamelCase text in findall().  This is especially necessary for ASP.NET applications that define classes using
      the notation ``CssClass="color-h979591 bold heading--1"``.
    |
    | **0.1.9** -- Fixed a major python 2.7 import error that prevented importing the correct settings file.
      Added ``absolute_import`` to all modules and
      unit tests per `PEP328 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#rationale-for-absolute-imports>`__.
    |
    | **0.2.0** -- Fixed an error that occurred when the ``display`` property was used with custom breakpoints.
      Enabled the use of `pseudo classes and pseudo elements <http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp>`__.

      For example: ::

        'color-blue-hover', 'padding-10rem-i-active', 'bgc-h048-visited', 'color-red-after', 'padding-20rem-i-before',
        'bgc-h096-selection'

    | Note that pseudo classes with parenthesis are excluded. Also, chaining pseudo items together is not implemented.
      Replaced the print statements in FileHandler with logging.debug to increase efficiency.
      Added ``'flex', 'inline-flex', and 'run-in'`` to ``display`` key in ``datalibrary.property_value_as_alias_dict``.
      Added ``'all' and 'align-items'`` properties.
    |
    | **0.2.1** -- Allow single quotes in HTML ``class='green'`` pattern. Enable parsing of ``*.cs`` files for HTML
      class declarations, CssClass, and ``*Attributes.Add("class", "bold padding-42");``.

      - Integrated Travis CI
      - Integrated Coveralls
      - Added shield.io badges from PyPi, Travis CI, and Coveralls to readme.

    | **0.2.2** -- Increased code test coverage. Fixed a math error in the CSS statistics printer. Azimuth was removed
      as it is now obsolete and has inconsistent browser support.
    |
    | **0.2.3** -- Fixed parsing errors associated with hexidecimal values that are mixed with the
      importance designator or pseudo classes. Changed readthedocs.org to readthedocs.io. Cleaned comments.
    |
    | **0.2.4** -- The ``-s`` designated scaling media queries now start scaling on large screens. Allow upper case
      letters for encoded hexidecimal values.
    |
    | **0.2.5** -- Fixed two regex errors: URIs (http://, ftp://) resemble inline JS comments (//) and ``://``
      needs to be removed first and foremost.  XHTML multi--line comment syntax ``<%-- ... --%>`` needs to be removed
      before ``<%...%>`` standard XHTML decorated expressions are removed since the regex is non-greedy and
      an XHTML expression decorated with ``<%...%>`` may exist within the multi-line comment. This results in an
      early non-greedy match between ``<%--`` and the closing ``%>`` of a commented out expression.
      Which contrasts with the desired closing substring of ``--%>``.
    |
    | **0.2.6** -- Created a filehandler.FileModificationComparator which runs under watchdog mode. This
      feature dramatically improves efficiency by only adding classes based on the files that changed
      before the last run of blowdrycss. The current CSS class selectors are now stored within the
      scope of the watchdog wrapper.

      A LimitTimer expires periodically (default is 30 minutes). The expiration triggers a parses
      of all files to delete unused classes.

      For those upgrading the package be sure to add ``time_limit = 1800`` to your current ``blowdrycss_settings.py``.

      Class selectors that were deleted by the user during file
      modification are temporarily ignored since all eligible files (including the ones
      not modified) would need to be parsed before deletion should be authorized. Deletion and full,
      comprehensive scans of all files now occurs every 1800 seconds (30 minutes). This value can be
      increased or decreased in the settings file by changing ``time_limit``.

      Added basic high-level design files.

      Force pypandoc==1.1.3 since pandoc doesn't properly install/upgrade on Windows in version 1.2.

      Commented out pip and setuptools from requirements.txt.

      PEP8 and typo corrections.

    | **0.2.7** -- Added a call to LimitTimer.reset() to fix a bug in which the LimitTimer never expired.
      Add two more color regexes which allow the case in which hex is be combined with a pseudo class.
      e.g. ``hffffff-hover`` or ``hfff-before``.
    |
    | **0.2.8** -- Performance enhancement during recent/on_modify case.  Only build the css_text based on new
      class selectors created during the most recent modification.  Append this to the pre-existing css_text then
      overwrite blowdry.css or blowdry.min.css. A new parameter css_text was added to blowdry.parse() and
      to the override for the watchdog event handler. Special test created to verify that the css_text is
      handled properly.
    |
    | **0.2.9** -- Extended LimitTimer with setters and getters for ``limit_time``. This prevents duplicate runs
      during watchdog mode. Since the watchdog modify event triggers twice on windows and mac. It can also
      depend on the IDE being used since some IDEs auto-save. Created an associated integration test.
    |
    | **0.3.0** -- Enabled support for the ``*.vue`` extension and added integration tests along with a
      simple test_vue folder. Requirements cleanup.
    |
    | **1.0.0** -- Enabled support for ``*.php`` extension and added integration tests. Incremented to 1.0.0 since the
      code is stable and working well.
    |
    | **1.0.1** -- Enabled support for output file_name and extension customization. Created settings validation
      utility functions and unit tests. Custom output file examples: _blowdry.scss and custom.css. Added support for
      Python 3.6.
    |
    | **1.0.2** -- Fixed file extension printing error. Now it uses the settings output_extension. Updated unit test.
