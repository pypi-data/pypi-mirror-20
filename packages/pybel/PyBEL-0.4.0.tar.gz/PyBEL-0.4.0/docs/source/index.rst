PyBEL Documentation
===================

Biological Expression Language (BEL) is a domain-specific language that enables the expression of complex molecular
relationships and their context in a machine-readable form. Its simple grammar and expressive power have led to its
successful use in the `IMI <https://www.imi.europa.eu/>`_ project, `AETIONOMY <http://www.aetionomy.eu/>`_, to describe
complex disease networks with several thousands of relationships.

PyBEL is a Python software package that parses BEL statements, validates their semantics, applies common graph
algorithms, and allows for data interchange with common formats like Neo4J, JSON, CSV, Excel, and SQL.

:code:`PyBEL` provides a simple API so bioinformaticians and scientists with limited programming knowledge can easily
use it to interface with BEL graphs, but is built on a rich framework that can be extended to develop new algorithms.

Installation is as easy as getting the code from PyPI with :code:`python3 -m pip install pybel`
