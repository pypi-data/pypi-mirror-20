Description: ==========
        dallasMQTT
        ==========
        dallasMQTT is a service that will periodically poll an arbitray number of
        dallas 1 wire sensors and publish the data to an MQTT broker.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        dallasMQTT is availably via pypi, so all you need to do is run::
        
            pip install -U dallasMQTT
        
        assuming you have pip installed. (which is the recommended way to install.
        If you need to use a development version of dallasMQTT you can clone the repo and install it locally with::
        
            git clone https://github.com/mtreinish/dallasMQTT.git
        
        and then install it with::
        
            pip install -e dallasMQTT
        
        which will install dallasMQTT in your python environment in editable mode for
        local development.
        
        If you don't have pip installed you can manually install dallasMQTT by
        cloning the repo and installing it from the repo base dir with::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        but, note installing via pip is the recommended and supported method of
        installing dallasMQTT. (even from a local git clone)
        
        Configuration
        =============
        To configure dallasMQTT you need to create configuration yaml file that will
        tell dallasMQTT how to access sensors, how to use MQTT, etc. The basic format
        of the file with the 3 sections is::
        
          mqtt:
              hostname: foo
        
          sensors:
              - id: id number
                name: 'My Sensor'
        
          default:
              poll_rate: 60
              base_topic: a_topic
        
        
        MQTT Section Configuration
        --------------------------
        This section is used to configure how dallasMQTT will connect to an MQTT broker.
        To configure the ``mqtt`` section there are 3 options it currently takes:
        
         * ``hostname``
         * ``username``
         * ``password``
        
        of these only ``hostname`` is **required**. The other 2 options are **optional**
        you can use ``username and`` ``password`` if client auth is desired (or
        required by your mqtt broker).
        
        Sensor Section Configuration
        ----------------------------
        The ``sensor`` section of the yaml config file is used to specify which sensors
        are to be polled and how to label them in the mqtt topics. It takes in a list
        of sensors of arbitrary size that takes in a combination of sensor ids and names
        for example if there were 3 sensors it would look something like::
        
            sensors:
                - id: 28-000001
                  name: Sensor1
                - id: 28-000002
                  name: Sensor2
                - id: 28-000003
                  name: Sensor3
        
        This pattern is just repeated for how ever many sensors you want dallasMQTT to
        poll. The ``name`` field is fairly self explanatory, and it is just the name
        of the sensor that will be used as the second half of the topic on mqtt, like::
        
            $base_topic/$name
        
        The id field is used to specify the sensor id to poll. dallasMQTT will poll
        the sensor file at::
        
            /sys/bus/w1/devices/``$id``/w1_slave
        
        So ensuring you put the proper id here is important otherwise dallasMQTT will
        not be able to read the sensor data.
        
        This section was written to be sufficiently broad so that in the future
        additional sensor types could be added to dallasMQTT. This would be a very
        simple addition and would just require adding an optional driver field to each
        list element which would tell dallasMQTT which class to use for polling sensors.
        (these additional sensor wouldn't necessarily have to be dallas 1 wire either)
        But, as of right now there is only 1 class, DallasTemp, for 1 wire temperature
        sensors, so this field doesn't exist. However, if/when dallasMQTT is updated
        to include other sensor types the documentation will be updated. (and backwards
        compatibility will be adhered to so as to not break anyone)
        
        Default Section configuration
        -----------------------------
        The default section is where you configure settings that contol the basic
        operation of dallasMQTT. There are 3 options in this section right now:
        
         * ``base_topic``
         * ``poll_rate``
         * ``max_threads``
        
        All 3 options are optional.
        
        ``base_topic`` is used to set the basic topic used on MQTT for sending sensor
        data. The messages will be sent on mqtt like::
        
            $base_topic/$sensor_name
        
        by default this is set to ``dallasMQTT``.
        
        ``poll_rate`` is used to specify a time in seconds to wait between polling
        the sensors on a worker thread. Note this is not time between individual sensors
        but between polling all the sensors being handled by a single thread. Each
        sensor in that group will be polled serially without any wait time between
        them.
        
        ``max_threads`` is used to specify the maximum number of threads that dallasMQTT
        will launch to poll sensors with. If there are less sensors in the configuration
        file a single worker thread will be launched for each sensor. If there are more
        sensors than threads the sensors will be equally distributed to the number of
        workers specified. Each worker will handle polling the list of sensors it
        received.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To run dallasMQTT is fairly straightforward. After dallasMQTT is installed
        you just run::
        
            dallasMQTT config.yaml
        
        where config.yaml is the path to your yaml config file.
