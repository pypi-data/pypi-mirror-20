Description: popLines
        ========
        
        Tools to pop (remove and return) lines from files, with a variety of modes.
        
        
        This allows you to treat a file on disk as a queue, or to easily strip lines from a file, and many other uses.
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
        	[cmd]$ cat test # Show original file
        
        	one
        
        	two
        
        	three
        
        	four
        
        	five
        
        
        	[cmd]$ popHead 2 test # Remove two lines from head of the file
        
        	one
        
        	two
        
        
        	[cmd]$ cat test # Show that lines have been removed from file
        
        	three
        
        	four
        
        	five
        
        
        
        
        Modes
        -----
        
        
        The followings modes and their associated command name are given:
        
        
        **Head** - popHead [numLines] [filename] - Removes "numLines" from the top of provided "filename", and prints them on stdout.
        
        
        **Tail** - popTail [numLines] [filename] - Removes "numLines" from the bottom of provided "filename", and prints them on stdout.
        
        
        **Random** - popRandom [numLines] [filename] - Removes "numLines" from random positions within provided "filename", and prints to stdout in a random order.
        
        
        **Range** - popRange [start] [stop] (optional: [step]) [filename] - Removes lines using inclusive 1-origin start, stop, and optional step, and prints to stdout. Negative numbers are supported to mean "from the end", -1 is last line, -2 is second-to-last line.
        
        
        **These** - popThese [line1] [...lineN] [filename] - Removes specific lines given 1-origin numbers. If numbers are out of range, that number will be ommited. Lines are returned in provided order, and duplicates are allowed. Negative numbers are supported to mean "from the end".
        
        
        
        Module
        ------
        
        Functionality is exposed through a module, PopLines, which can perform all the same operations.
