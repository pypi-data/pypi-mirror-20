======================================

|Build Status| |Supported Python versions|

Have you ever dreamed of a better output of ``dir()``? I do. So I
created this.

Features
--------

-  Attributes are grouped by types/functionalities, with beautiful
   colors.

-  Support all platforms including Windows(Thanks to
   `colorama <https://github.com/tartley/colorama>`__).

-  Support `ipython <https://github.com/ipython/ipython>`__,
   `ptpython <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython>`__ and
   `bpython <https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/>`__! See
   `wiki <https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/wiki#repl-support>`__ for
   more information.

-  The return value of ``pdir()`` can still be used as a list of names.

-  You can search for certain names with ``.s()`` or ``.search()``:

Search is case-insensitive by default. You can use
``.search(name, case_sensitive=True)`` to do case sensitive searching.

Install
-------

::

    pip install pdir2

About the name. I wanted to call it ``pdir``, but there's already one
with this name on pypi. Mine is better, of course.

Testing
-------

Simply run ``pytest``, or use ``tox`` if you like.
