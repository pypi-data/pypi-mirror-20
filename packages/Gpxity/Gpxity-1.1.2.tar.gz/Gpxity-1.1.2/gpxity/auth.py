    """
    Get username and password from auth.cfg. If nothing is
    useable, sets them to None.

    auth.cfg is expected in :literal:`~/.config/Gpxity/auth.cfg`

    .. DANGER::
       auth.cfg is not encrypted. Better not use this unless you know what you are doing!

    Args:
        cls (Backend): The class of the backend
        sub_name (str): Be more specific. This can be used to define different data for some tests.

    Attributes:
        auth (tuple(str,str)): (username, password). Both are either str or None.

    auth.cfg has sections
      * [default]             most general fallback
      * [ClassName]           the class name of a backend like MMT
      * [ClassName.sub_name]  can be used for a specific account

    Those sections are tried from most specific to default until
    both username and password are known. It is legal if a more
    specific section only defines username or password.
