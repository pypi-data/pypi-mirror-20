newrelic-cli allows setting up your New Relic monitors using simple CLI tool.
Also it provides a set of libraries that can be easily integrated in other
Python projects. It is based on `v3` version of the API when possible,
falling back to `v2` when features are not available in `v3`.


Currently only Synthetics monitors and alerts are supported.
