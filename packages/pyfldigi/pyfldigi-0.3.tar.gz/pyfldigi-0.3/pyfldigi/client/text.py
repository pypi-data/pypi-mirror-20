    .. note::
        This class spawns a TX Monitor thread that ensures the transmitter gets keyed on and off at the appropriate
        times.  It monitors Transmit duty cycle (%), max transmit time (seconds) aka Dead Man's Switch?, and max text
        length.  You can set these with the getters and setters below, but you should probably just leave them alone.

        You get all of this functionality for free.  I don't see any use-case where it wouldn't be useful, so it can't be disabled.
        It uses a daemon thread which starts when Client() is instantiated (which calls Text()), and ends when the program shuts down.

    .. note:: An instance of this class automatically gets created under :py:class:`pyfldigi.client.client.Client` when it is constructed.
