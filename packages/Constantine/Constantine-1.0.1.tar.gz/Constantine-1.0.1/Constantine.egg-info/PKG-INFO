Description: Constantine
        ===================
        Constantine is a [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) tool for automatically generating event posters from public Google Calendar events. It is primarily written for [HackSoc](https://hacksoc.org) of University of York to partially automate some publicity work, but is written in a very adaptable way for other uses. It uses [XeTex](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) for PDF typesetting.
        
        Constantine requires Python 3.3+ and XeLaTeX.
        
        #Installation#
        First, to access Google Calendar, even just for public events, you need a Google API Key, which can be obtained by visiting Google API Console [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), you may wish to create a new Google API project for Constantine when prompted.
        
        After obtaining the API Key, edit `settings.json` as required:
        * `logo`: either relative path (when executing from source script, does *not* start with `/`) or absolute path (when installed as a package, starts with `/`) to your organisation's logo, which is highly recommended to be a background-transparent PNG file.
        * `url`, `email`, `irc_network`, `irc_channel`, `twitter`, `facebook`: contact information for your organisation, modify as appropriate.
        * `calendar_id`: the Google Calendar ID for the calendar you want to fetch events from, a guide for finding the ID can be found [here](https://support.appmachine.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645966-Find-your-Google-Calendar-ID-for-the-Events-block).
        * `google_api_key`: the Google API Key you just obtained above, the default one is access-restricted and will **not** work for you.
        * `term_start_dates`: a list of dates for starts-of-terms, used for University of York's week numbering, as it appears in the generated PDF.
        * `page_background_colour`, `page_normal_text_colour`, `page_emphasis_text_colour`, `page_deemphasis_text_colour`: Hex colour codes for the background and text colours in the generated PDF, modify if you would like to change the colour scheme.
        
        Constantine only has one dependent package, [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), which if used as source script, can be installed by:
        
            pip install requests
        
        If used as a package, requests should have been installed by pip automatically.
        
        Make sure that XeLaTeX works on your system by executing `xelatex -version`, then run Constantine with:
        
        Running from source script:
        
            python main.py /path/to/output.pdf
        
        Running from package
        
            Constantine /path/to/output.pdf
        
        And it's done. If any error occurs outputs should provide some clue.
        
        #ToDo's#
        * In LaTeX, `multicols*`(multiple columns without balancing) cannot be used inside a box, without which the bottom dotted line seems difficulty to fit. I am pretty terrible at LaTeX, so if you have a better solution please do send a pull request :)
