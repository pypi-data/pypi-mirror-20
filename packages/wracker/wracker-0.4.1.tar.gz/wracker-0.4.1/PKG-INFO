Description: # Wracker
        
        (PRE-ALPHA DO NOT USE) A Python clone of bundler.  The wheel racker!
        
        ## Commands
        
        * `wracker install` installs packages from a `requirements.in` file (in your CWD
          or parent directories) and writes the specific versions to `requirements.txt`
        
        * `wracker exec` sets `$PYTHONPATH` to use only the packages in your
          requirements.txt, nothing more.  It also modifies `$PATH` to point to a
          'clean' virtualenv, which wracker manages for you.  These virtualenvs do not
          have `pip` installed so hopefully they never become polluted (although there
          are no hard locks in place or anything like that).
        
          It also adds entrypoints to your `$PATH`, so `wracker exec pep8` will use a
          frozen pep8 if available.
        
        ## Todo
        
        (Presented in no particular order.)

        * [ ] `-r` includes

        * [ ] Tests
