Description: `k8senv` is a simple way to manage your different Kubernetes contexts.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            $ pip install k8senv
        
        It's recommended to remove your default Kubernetes context, so you don't
        accidentially invoke it:
        
            $ kubectl config unset current-context
        
        You may also want to export your shell prompt:
        
            $ echo 'export PS1' >> ~/.bash_profile
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To start using a Kubernetes context:
        
            $ k8senv <context>
        
        Now any calls to `kubectl` within your shell will use that context.
        
        To list available contexts:
        
            $ k8senv --list
