================

This is a script to be used as Mutt’s `query_command`.  So far it can only
query LDAP directories, but it is intended to be capable of more once I’m done.

Config
------
Put at `./config.ini` or at `~/.mutt-addressbook.ini` or specify with `-C
$config`.  Be inspired by `config.sample.ini`.
