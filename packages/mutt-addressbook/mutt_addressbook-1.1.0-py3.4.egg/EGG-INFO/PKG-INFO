Description: ================
        mutt-addressbook
        ================
        
        This is a script to be used as Mutt’s `query_command`.  So far it can only
        query LDAP directories, but it is intended to be capable of more once I’m done.
        
        Config
        ------
        Put at `./config.ini` or at `~/.mutt-addressbook.ini` or specify with `-C
        $config`.  Be inspired by `config.sample.ini`.
