-------------------

**New Features:**

**Fixed:**

2.6.0 (2017-03-17)
-------------------

**New Features:**
- Adding get_tuple() to Locator object. This is to make passing between SeleniumPM and the Selenium libraries eaiser
- Adding simpler way of defining Locators. Locators can now be created via Locator.by_xpath(path) or Locator.by_css_selector(path). The following types are supported:
    * by_xpath(path)
    * by_css_selector(path)

- Adding wait_for_selected() to Element
- Adding wait_for_clickable() and click_invisible() to Clickable
- Adding send_keys_delayed() and type_delayed() to TextField
- Adding new Panel type that simply extends Widget. Conceptually they're exactly the same, but Panel appears to be a more generally acceptable term for a section of a page

**Fixed:**
- Simplifying README for more of a project overview. Details should be located on the wiki

2.5.2 (2017-03-07)
-------------------

**New Features:**

**Fixed:**

- Fixing issue with setup.py throwing error missing HISTORY.rst from package data

2.5.1 (2017-03-07) - BROKEN
-------------------

**New Features:**

**Fixed:**

- Fixing issue with set_focus() or scroll_into_view(). They were apparently not included in 2.5.0 release

2.5.0 (2017-03-07) - BROKEN
-------------------

**New Features:**

- Addition of RadioButton type
- Addition of Dropdown type
- Addition of Image type
- Add new method get_element_attr() to Webpage and Widget type. This will give developers access to all define
  Element attributes on a Webpage or within a Widget. This method all supports retrieving a specific Element type
  (e.g. Button, Link, Checkbox)
- Changing default wait_for_page_load() and validate() methods to use the above mentioned get_element_attr(). This can
  still be overridden, and does not affect previous implementations.
- Adding new seleniumpm.examples.widgets package
- Element class now implements a get_action_chains() method to return back an ActionChains type.
- Element class now implements a set_focus() or scroll_into_view() functionality, for those pesky webelements that are
  need to be visible, but are corrently scrolled off page somehow.

**Fixed:**

- Adding type-checking to constructor of the Element, Widget, and Webpage types. These classes will now throw an
  AttributeError if not passed in a legitimate RemoteWebdriver, URL, or Locator type as parameters.

2.4.2 (2017-02-13)
------------------

**New Features:**

**Fixed:**

- Using setuptools for setup.py.

2.4.1 (2017-02-13)
------------------

- Using disutils.core instead of setuptools for setup.py. Hoping this fixes pretty-print of rst files on PyPi

2.4.0 (2017-02-13)
------------------

**New Features:**

- Better support for Table type and interacting with them on a page. This includes support for 'search' operations and
  enumerating over rows and columns

  object(s).
- Implementation of object equality for all Selenium Page Model classes
- UnitTests are now using PhantomJS (Headless) target
- Removal of requestest dependency to keep the project simple

**Fixed:**

- The Widget type was missing in 2.3.0 release
- Expanding of the UnitTest coverage to ensure libraries are working correctly
- Fixing issue with get_text() in Python Selenium. Apparently, this call in Python (versus Java) is simply called 'text'
- Conversion of README and HISTORY files to rst. This is so that they are rendered correctly on PyPi server
