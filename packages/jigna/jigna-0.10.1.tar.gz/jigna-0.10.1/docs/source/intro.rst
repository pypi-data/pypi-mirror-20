Introduction
=============

Jigna aims to provide an HTML based solution for creating beautiful user
interfaces for Python applications, as opposed to widget based toolkits like
Qt/wx or native toolkits. It provides a seamless two-way data binding between
the Python model and the HTML view by creating a Python-JS communication
bridge. This ensures that the view is always live as it can automatically
update itself when the model changes, and update the model when user actions
take place on the UI. The Jigna view can be rendered in an in-process Qt
widget or over the web in a browser.

The primary use of jigna is to provide a way to write desktop GUI applications
using HTML, and we use the Qt backend for that. You can also use jigna to write
GUIs that run on the browser. This is done via the web backend.


Installation
============

Jigna works with Python 2.x and Python 3.x (although for 3.x, you have to install
the dependencies yourself).

The setup procedure is simple. Make sure you have a Python installation to
which you have write access and run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install jigna

This will not pull in any Qt requirements but will require tornado_ as it is
easy to install.  The test requirements can be installed via::

    $ pip install jigna[test]

This will install, PySide, nose, mock, coverage, and selenium_ if you do not
already have them.

You may also use the ``requirements.txt`` file to install the necessary
dependencies. This does not install PyQt or PySide though.


Examples
========

There are several examples to get started, look in the ``examples/`` directory
and run them.

Tests
=====

Running the tests requires selenium_ and nose_.  The tests are in
``jigna/tests/``.  You may run them from the root directory of the sources
using ``nosetests``.

.. _selenium: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium
.. _nose: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose
.. _Traits: http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/
.. _tornado: http://tornadoweb.org

Getting Started
===============

Let us say we have a nice application model written in Python (specifically,
in Traits_)::

    from traits.api import HasTraits, Str

    class Person(HasTraits):
        name = Str
        greeting = Str
        def _name_changed(self):
            self.greeting = "Hello " + self.name

    person = Person(name='Fred')

Jigna lets you visualize this model using HTML such that the model and the
view are fully connected. Here is a sample HTML (an AngularJS_ template)::

    body_html = """
   	Name: <input ng-model="person.name"/><br>
   	Greeting:
   	<h1>{{person.greeting}}</h1>
    """

Notice how the HTML is directly referencing model attributes via ``person.name``
and ``person.greeting``. We now bind this declarative view to the model and
create a Qt based UI::

    from jigna.api import HTMLWidget, Template
    template = Template(body_html=body_html)

    from jigna.qt import QtGui
    app = QtGui.QApplication([])
    widget = HTMLWidget(template=template, context={'person': person})
    widget.show()
    app.exec_()

This produces a Qt window containing an HTML UI which responds automatically to
any changes in the model and vice-versa. It can optionally be styled with CSS
and made interactive with Javascript. This provides a nice way of easily
building rich, live user interfaces for Python apps. Note that the Qt imports
were made using the ``jigna.qt`` module. This module allows one to switch
between PySide and PyQt easily by exporting an environment variable ``QT_API``,
if this is set to ``pyside`` then ``PySide`` will be used and if it is set to
``pyqt`` then ``PyQt`` will be used.

This is nice for several reasons:

 * The view code is declarative and hence easy to read.

 * The binding between the model and the view is automatic.

 * HTML/CSS/JS today is very powerful

   - there are many JS libraries for a variety of tasks

   - your development team doesn't have to worry about creating widgets or the
     limitations in the toolkitâ€™s widget set as there are thousands of
     developers worldwide creating awesome CSS/JS widgets for you.

 * Much easier to find people who know HTML/CSS/JS than Qt or a native toolkit.

 * There is a complete separation of view from the model and this allows us to
   hand off the entire UI to an HTML/CSS/JS guru.

And since this is HTML, the jigna ``Template`` can also be easily served
on a web browser if you don't have Qt installed. The wiring changes a bit for
this, so the final example looks like this::

    from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
    from jigna.web_app import WebApp

    ioloop = IOLoop.instance()

    app = WebApp(template=template, context={'person': person})
    app.listen(8000)

    # Serving the app on http://localhost:8000/.
    ioloop.start()

This starts up a web server to which one can connect multiple browsers to see
and interact with the model.

Please note that any imports from ``jigna.api`` will try and import Qt modules
if they are installed, so if you need an application with a pure web-based UI
and wish to avoid those imports, you may wish to use the following imports::

    from jigna.template import Template
    from jigna.web_app import WebApp

The above example was very simple as the purpose of that was to show how
jigna is wired together. For further use cases of jigna, please refer to the
examples in the ``examples`` directory. They are numbered and are meant to act
as a tutorial if followed in sequence.

.. _AngularJS: http://angularjs.org/


One may also use `Vue.js`_ to build the HTML UI. The approach is very similar to
that using AngularJS.  A Vue template is available from::

    from jigna.vue_template import VueTemplate

An example showing how to use this with a Qt app is in
`examples/ex22_vuejs_demo.py
<https://github.com/enthought/jigna/blob/master/examples/ex22_vuejs_demo.py>`_
with the corresponding HTML file in `examples/ex22_vuejs_demo.html
<https://github.com/enthought/jigna/blob/master/examples/ex22_vuejs_demo.html>`_.

A similar example showing how to use this with a pure web-based app is in
`examples/ex23_vuejs_demo.py
<https://github.com/enthought/jigna/blob/master/examples/ex23_vuejs_demo.py>`_.
The HTML file is the same.
