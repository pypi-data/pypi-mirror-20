This is a low-level, pure Python DBus protocol client. It has an IO-free core,
and integration modules for different event loops.

DBus is an inter-process communication system, mainly used in Linux.

This project is experimental, and you use it at your own risk. There are a
number of `more mature Python DBus bindings <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings/#python>`__.
