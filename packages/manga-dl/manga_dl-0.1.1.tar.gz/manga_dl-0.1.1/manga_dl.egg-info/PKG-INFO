        ## Usage
        
        ### Installation
        
        **Via pip**
        
            $ pip install manga_dl --user
        
        **From source**
        
            $ python setup.py install --user
        
        **Binary Files**
        
        If you would like to not install the program and instead use a single binary
        file, you can download them from our [Github releases page](https://github.com/namboy94/manga-downloader/releases).
        
        ### CLI
        
        The program offers a simple wget-like CLI. To download a series, simply enter:
            
            $ manga-dl <URL>
            
        This will create a new directory with the series name in the current working
        directory and subsequently download all currently available pages of the series
        
        The CLI does offer some configuration:
        
        * ```--destination```, ```-d``` (type: string)
          - Specifies the directory in which the series will be stored
          - Defaults to the current working directory + the series name
        * ```--threads```, ```-t``` (type: integer)
          - Specifies how many threads the program may use. Using more threads may speed up the parsing
          - Defaults to the amount of logical processors the system has
        * ```--verbose```, ```-v```
          - If set, the program will print it's progress to the console
        * ```--update```
          - If set, the program will only check for content that have not been downloaded yet
        * ```--repair```
          - If set, the program will check each previously downloaded file for errors
          - If errors are found, the file in question is re-downloaded
        * ```--zip-volumes```
          - Zips the series by volume after the download is completed
        * ```--zip-chapters```
          - Zips the series by chapter after the download is completed
