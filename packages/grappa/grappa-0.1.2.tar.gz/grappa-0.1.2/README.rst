About
-----

``grappa`` is a behavior-oriented, self-declarative, expressive and developer-friendly
lightweight assertion library for Python_.

``grappa`` comes with two declarative `assertion styles`_: ``expect`` and ``should``.

It also comes with a detailed, human-friendly `error reporting`_ system that aims to reduce friction,
provide better feedback and improve human speed and agility while identifying and fixing errors.

To get started, take a look to the `showcase`_ code, `demo`_, `tutorial`_ and `documentation`_.

Status
------

``grappa`` is currently **beta quality** software. Contributions and issue reporting is welcome.

Showcase
--------

A small example demonstrating some `grappa` features:

.. code-block:: python

    from grappa import should

    True | should.be.true
    False | should.be.false
    None | should.be.none

    'bar' | should.be.equal.to('bar')
    13.14 | should.be.lower.than(14)
    13.14 | should.be.higher.than(13)

    'Hello grappa' | should.match('(\W)+ grappa$')
    'Hello grappa' | should.contain('grappa') | should.contain('he')

    {'foo': True} | should.be.a('dict')
    [1, 2, 3] | should.be.a('list') > should.have.length.of(3)
    (lambda x: x) | should.not_be.have.type.of('lambda')

    {'foo': 'bar'} | should.have.key('foo').that.should.be.equal.to('bar')
    (1, 2, 3, 4) | should.be.a(tuple) > should.have.index.at(3) > should.be.equal.to(4)

    an_object | should.have.properties('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
    an_object | should.implement.methods('foo', 'bar', 'baz')

    ({'bar': [1, 2, 3]}
        | should.have.key('bar')
        > should.be.a('list')
        > should.have.length.of(3)
        > should.contain.item(3)
        > should.have.index.at(1)
        > should.be.equal.to(2))

See `documentation`_ for more examples.

Why grappa?
-----------

``grappa`` aims to assist humans while doing a very recurrent and not very fun task in software development: testing things.

The core idea behind ``grappa`` comes from the fact that human time is considerably more expensive than machine time,
and therefore any machine assistance to optimize processes and close the gap is beneficial.

With ``grappa`` you can express almost in plain English what the test contract actually is, but in a way that's
fun and easy to write but also more easy and pleasant to read or maintain by other developers.


The Zen of grappa
-----------------

- Testing is about feedback: detailed, easy to understand, human-friendly is always better.
- Frictionless testing: introducing self-declarative behavior testing patterns can make testing more fun for test writers and more enjoyable for test readers.
- Expressivity is paramount: humans should easily understand what the code is doing.
- Human time is expensive: any modern software should assist people to identify and understand errors easily.
- Make error reporting great again: feedback during testing is key, let's make it more handy and less frustrating.
- Testing patterns consolidation: software expectations are limited to the boundaries of language data types and structures.
- Hurt less feelings: seeing errors is not a nice thing, but it can be painless if details are showed you in a more gentle way.


Features
--------

-  Behavior-oriented expressive fluent API.
-  Built-in assertion DSL with English lexicon and semantics.
-  Supports both ``expect`` and ``should`` assertion styles.
-  Full-featured built-in `assertion operators`_.
-  Human-friendly and detailed `error reporting`_.
-  Built-in expectations difference comparison between subject and expected values.
-  Extensible assertions supporting third-party `plugins`_.
-  Assertion chaining and composition.
-  Composable assertion via logical operators such as ``and`` & ``or``.
-  Testing framework agnostic. Works with ``unittest``, ``nosetests``, ``pytest``, ``behave`` ...
-  Easy to hack via programmatic API.
-  Lightweight and (almost) dependency-free.
-  Works with Python 2.7+, 3+, PyPy and potentially with other Python implementations.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade grappa
