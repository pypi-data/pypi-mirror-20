Description: PyVISA-py
        =========
        
        A PyVISA backend that implements a large part of the "Virtual Instrument Software
        Architecture" (VISA_) in pure Python (with the help of some nice cross platform
        libraries python packages!).
        
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        PyVISA started as wrapper for the NI-VISA library and therefore you need to install
        National Instruments VISA library in your system. This works most of the time,
        for most people. But NI-VISA is a proprietary library that only works on certain
        systems. That is when PyVISA-py jumps in.
        
        Starting from version 1.6, PyVISA allows to use different backends. These backends can be
        dynamically loaded. PyVISA-py is one of such backends. It implements most of the methods
        for Message Based communication (Serial/USB/GPIB/Ethernet) using Python and some well developed,
        easy to deploy and cross platform libraries

        VISA and Python
        ---------------
        
        Python has a couple of features that make it very interesting for measurement controlling:
        
        - Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.
        - It represents a high abstraction level, which perfectly blends with the abstraction
          level of measurement programs.
        - It has a very rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting modules for
          data analysis and visualisation.
        - A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is available.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python (tested with 2.6 and 2.7, 3.2+)
        - PyVISA 1.6+
        
        Optionally
        - PySerial (to interface with Serial instruments)
        - PyUSB (to interface with USB instruments)
        - linux-gpib (to interface with gpib instruments, only on linux)
        
        
        Installation
        --------------
        
        Using pip:
        
            $ pip install pyvisa-py
