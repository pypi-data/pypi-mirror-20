        Cast All The Things allows you to send videos from many, many online sources
        (YouTube, Vimeo, and a few hundred others) to your Chromecast. It also allows
        you to cast local files.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install Cast All The Things with pip::
        
            pip install catt
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To use Cast All The Things, just specify a URL::
        
            catt cast "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZMfhtKa-wo"
        
        CATT supports any service that youtube-dl supports, which includes most online
        video hosting services.
        
        CATT can also cast local files (if they're in a format the Chromecast supports
        natively)::
        
            catt cast ./myvideo.mp4
        
        You can also control your Chromecast through ``catt`` commands, for example with
        ``catt pause``. Try running ``catt --help`` to see the full list of commands.
