        Features
        ````````
        
        * Run the addon from the command line *or* within Kodi without changing any
          code.
        * Helper libraries to make common Kodi api operations easy, like adding items,
          getting settings, creating temporary files, etc.
        * Handles all the url parsing involved in plugin routing. No need to deal with
          complicated URLs and query strings.
