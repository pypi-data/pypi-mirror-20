    Component OPRs are calculated by solving the overdetermined system team1 + team2 + team3 = alliance statistic for
     all teams at the event. This is done by creating a match matrix A, and then solving Ax = b for each statistic,
     with x being a horizontal vector containing team OPRs, and b a vertical vector containing the alliance statistic.

    Keyworded arguments are either :
        strings: A DPath string to the path in the match object to get the score from. To search from the root of the
            match object, prefix your path with '/'. Otherwise, you will search from the score_breakdown object. Use ##ALLIANCE
            ##OPPALLIANCE to stand in for the proper alliance name.
        functions: given the match object and current alliance as an arguments, return a score value.

    Total alliance score is included by default. The results of the OPR calculation are stored in a dict for each
        team, keyed under the team's key in the return dict. The keys in each team's score dict are the same as the
        provided arguments.

    Example:
        def tower_strength(match, alliance):
            tower = 'red' if alliance == 'blue' else 'blue'
            return 8 - match['score_breakdown'][tower]['towerEndStrength']
