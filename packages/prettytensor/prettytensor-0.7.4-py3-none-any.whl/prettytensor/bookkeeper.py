Variable Names
===

Variables names use separate scoping to names.  This is because namescope is
designed for unique names and is somewhat dependent on creation order.  Saved
and loaded variables need to have consistent names across refactorings and model
tweaks. This means that the same variable will be reused if it has the same
name, even if it is in a disconnected subgraph.

class SimpleStateSaver(object):
  """A minimal implementation of a recurrent neural net state saver.

  There are effectively two ways to run training or inference on a recurrent
  neural net. One is to run inference or training one sample at a time. In this
  case, the "recurrent state" - in the simplest case, the recurrent layer
  activations - needs to be stored across time steps; i.e.:
    while (t < N) { output[t], state[t] = network(input[t], state[t-1]); }

  The alternative approach is to unroll the network in time, effectively
  creating an N-layer non-recurrent neural net for N time steps. This approach
  is stateless but requires a decision on the size of N.

  At runtime, the first approach is commonly used - however, it requires
  persisting the state across time steps somehow. This is what "state savers"
  do - e.g. this class - by providing two calls, state() and save_state().
  Under the hood, this could lead to storing the state in an actual Tensorflow
  variable, but in this minimal state saver, no saving/restoring is actually
  performed - instead, placeholder or constant nodes for state restoring,
  and no_op nodes for state saving, are added to the graph. This allows
  state saving to be performed outside of the Tensorflow runtime, by using
  feeds and fetches on these added nodes (see Tensorflow's Session.run()
  for details on feeds/fetches). Using feeds/fetches instead of Tensorflow
  variables adds a lot of flexibility but also imposes the burden on the caller
  to take care of feeding and fetching states - to hide this complexity from
  Python users, we recommend using the RecurrentRunner class to run inference
  on recurrent networks.

  Feeds and fetches are not commonly supported for training in Tensorflow so an
  alternative approach is required. As described above, recurrent networks are
  usually unrolled to a fixed number of time steps, N, which may be larger, or
  shorter, than the longest training sequence. When longer (i.e. the network is
  large enough to train all sequences in their entirety), this class can be used
  (it doesn't do anything except for providing the initial state value - all
  Zeros). When the unrolled network is shorter than the longest sequence, each
  training example S is split into chunks of size N - s1, s2, ... - and the
  network is trained on these chunks, with one important added detail: The
  recurrent state of the network at the end of s1 is used as the initial value
  for the state when training on s2. This scenario requires more elaborate
  state savers that know when an input sequence is over to reset the state -
  e.g. StateSavingLegacyInput - and is not supported by SimpleStateSaver.
