"""Reusable TensorFlow functions.

This file is divided into roughly 4 parts:

* _regression functions with signature: `fn(y, target, name=)` where y is
  the output of your DNN and target is the regression target as a tensor and
  the result is a tensor with shape [1].
* _distance functions with signature: `fn(t1, t2, name=) where t1 and t2 are
  both tensors and the result is a tensor with shape [N] where N is the first
  dimension of t1 and t2.
* Activation functions with signature `fn(x, name=)` where x is a tensor
  and the result is a tensor of the same shape.
* Utility functions. These include normalizations that are used in embedding
  models as a non-linearity and a few others.
