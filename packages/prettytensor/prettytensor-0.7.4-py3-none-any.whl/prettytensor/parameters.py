r"""Provides some standard functions to modify parameter variables.

These are applied before the variables are used within the graph; the basic
function signature is:

    def my_func(var_name, variable, phase):
      \"""A function to apply to a model's parameters.

      Args:
        var_name: The short name for the variable.
        variable: A `Tensor` that can be used in the model. Note: this is often
          a tf.Variable, but may not be and the name only usually contains
          var_name (it doesn't in the case of reuse).
        phase: The phase of model construction.

      Returns:
        A `Variable` or `Tensor` with the same shape and type as `variable` to
        use.
