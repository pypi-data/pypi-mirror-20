class ReplayableQueue(object):
  """A switchable queue between the original data and a replayed subset.

  This queue combines 2 concepts:

  1. A replay queue that re-enqueues the data every time it is dequeued so that
      multiple passes over the same data can be made (make sure to iterated
      `replay_steps` times).
  2. The ability to switch data sources between the original source and the
      replayable queue. Embedding the switch makes it easy to construct a single
      graph on top of both input sources.

  Note: The queue requires manual filling by calling `refill`!

  The typical use case for replaying data is when you want to run an experiment
  on a subset of the training data and need to reuse the data multiple times.

  Here is an example that uses the replay queue to monitor loss on a dynamically
  selected validation set:

  ```
  replay = pt.train.ReplayableQueue(lambda: MY_Q.dequeue_many(BATCH_SIZE),
                                REPLAY_SIZE)
  # Build a graph with replay.output
  my_train_op, my_loss = build_graph(replay.output)

  with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Capture some data
    replay.refill(sess)

    for epoch in xrange(EPOCHS):
      # Train for a while
      for _ in xrange(1000):
        sess.run(my_train_op)
      loss = 0
      with replay.replay_scope():
        for _ in xrange(replay.replay_steps):
          loss += sess.run(my_loss)
        loss /= replay.replay_steps
      print('Loss at epoch %d: %g' % (epoch, loss))
