Description: # Mountebank
        
        This is a simple wrapper library around mountebank. It's useful for mocking
        HTTP API services.
        
        ## Usage
        
            from mountebank import Imposter
        
            imposter = Imposter()
            imposter.add_stub("/text", "GET", "What I'm expecting")
            with imposter.mockhttp() as url:
                assert requests.get(url + "/test").text == "What I'm expecting"
        
        
        ## Development
        
        To run the containers:
        
            docker-compose up --build
        
        To test:
        
            docker-compose exec tests /bin/bash -c "cd /apps/mountebank/tests;pytest"
            docker-compose exec tests2 /bin/bash -c "cd /apps/mountebank/tests;pytest"
