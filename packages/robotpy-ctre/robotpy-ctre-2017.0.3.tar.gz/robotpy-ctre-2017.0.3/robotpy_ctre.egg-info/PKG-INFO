Description: robotpy-ctre
        ============
        
        This is a python wrapper around the CTRE 3rd party library. Documentation can be
        found at http://robotpy-ctre.readthedocs.io/
        
        **NOTE**: The RobotPy project is not associated with or endorsed by Cross The 
        Road Electronics.
        
        Setup (simulator)
        -----------------
        
            pip3 install robotpy-ctre
        
        Setup (RoboRIO)
        ---------------
        
        You really don't want to compile this yourself, so don't download this from pypi
        and install it. Instead, you can download a pre-packaged version from our opkg repository. Use the RobotPy installation script (comes with the RobotPy download), and run the following on your computer while connected to the internet::
        
          py -3 installer.py download-opkg python36-robotpy-ctre
          
        Then, when connected to the roborio's network, run::
        
          py -3 installer.py install-opkg python36-robotpy-ctre
        
        For more information about installing packages, see https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-packages
        
        Compilation
        ===========
        
        Currently, compilation is only supported on the RoboRIO or the RoboRIO VM. Use
        opkg to install g++ et al, install libstdc++-dev, and then run::
        
            pip3 install pybind11 wheel
            pip3 wheel .
        
        Be warned that it takes a very long time to compile, and that if you're using
        a real RoboRIO that you will need a swap device installed.
