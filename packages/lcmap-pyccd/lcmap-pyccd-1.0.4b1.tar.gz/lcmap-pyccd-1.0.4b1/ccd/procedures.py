"""Functions for providing the over-arching methodology. Tying together the
individual components that make-up the change detection process.

The results of this process is a list-of-lists of change models that correspond
to observation spectra. A processing mask is also returned, outlining which
observations were utilized and which were not.

Pre-processing routines are essential to, but distinct from, the core change
detection algorithm. See the `ccd.qa` for more details related to this
step.

For more information please refer to the `pyccd Algorithm Description Document`.
