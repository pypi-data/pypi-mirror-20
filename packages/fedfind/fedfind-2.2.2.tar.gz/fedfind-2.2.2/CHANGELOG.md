### 2.0.0 - 2016-02-29

*   [fedfind-2.0.0.tar.xz](https://www.happyassassin.net/fedfind/releases/fedfind-2.0.0.tar.xz)

fedfind 2.0 is a **really major** release which pretty much rewrites fedfind for a world where Fedora composes are done with Pungi 4. It is more incompatible than not with fedfind 1.x, existing users are almost certain to need changes. Only the CLI interface is mostly unchanged (the `--respin / -i` argument is added, but is optional and all previous invocations should still work and return as close as possible to the same results).

If you have code which uses fedfind you may *seriously consider* stopping using it entirely; it is possible you can achieve your requirements now with Pungi 4 compose metadata and information from [PDC](https://pdc.fedoraproject.org). The primary use cases for fedfind now are only locating composes (if fedmsg messages are not sufficient for you; the locations of new composes are sent out via fedmsg now), synthesizing the `payload` concept which is still missing from productmd, and (to an extent) making it possible to interact with non-Pungi 4 composes in the same way as Pungi 4 composes, if you need to do that (i.e. if you need to deal with old stable releases or the two-week Atomic nightly composes). If you do not need to do any of those things you likely no longer need fedfind.

1. **API** `Image` and `Query` classes dropped entirely
2. **API** `kojiclient.py` (and the `ClientSession` class) removed
3. **API** Many now-unneeded constants from `fedfind.const` removed
4. **API** `respin` concept added to versioning to account for Pungi 4 composes using it
5. **API** `Compose` and `Milestone` classes temporarily dropped as we don't yet know how to do them with Pungi 4
6. **API** `Release.all_images` is now a list of productmd-style image dicts, not of fedfind `Image` instances
7. **API** `Release.koji_done` and `Release.pungi_done` replaced by a single `Release.done` property
8. **API** `Release.check_expected` and `Release.difference` now return `(payload, type, arch)` 3-tuples
9. **API** `Release.find_images` is removed
10. **API** `Release.image_from_url_or_path` is removed
11. **API** `Nightly.all_boot_images` and `Nightly.all_koji_images` are removed
12. **API** `Nightly.get_koji_tasks` and `Nightly.get_koji_images` are removed
13. **API** `MirrorRelease.get_mirror_images()` is removed
14. **API** use unicode literals and print function on Python 2
15. **NEW** `Release.metadata` dict of productmd-style metadata is added
16. **NEW** `Release.location` top-level release location property is added (faked up for non-Pungi 4 releases)
17. **NEW** `Release.cid` 'compose ID' property is added (sloppily faked for non-Pungi 4 releases)
18. **NEW** `Release.all_paths` added (though you're most likely to want `all_images`)
19. Synthesis of `payload` property adapted from old `Image` code
20. Synthesis of partly productmd-compatible metadata for non-Pungi 4 composes
21. Some embryonic support for querying stuff in PDC

### 1.4.2 - 2015-08-21

*   [fedfind-1.4.2.tar.xz](https://www.happyassassin.net/fedfind/releases/fedfind-1.4.2.tar.xz)

1.  Fix a bug in `koji_done` caused by the query opt fixes in 1.4
2.  Add Branched release guessing (so you can pass `-m Branched` and it will guess the release number). Will also guess today's date if you don't pass `-c`
3.  Fix a bug in rsync calls which meant we were getting more data than we meant to

### 1.4 - 2015-08-20

*   [fedfind-1.4.tar.xz](https://www.happyassassin.net/fedfind/releases/fedfind-1.4.tar.xz)

1.  Drop the `multiprocessing` stuff from 1.3, use xmlrpclib `multicall` to batch Koji requests instead
2.  Improve the Koji caching mechanism for partial matches
3.  Fix wrong opt names in Koji query opts (some queries weren't actually doing what they meant to do at all)

3.  Various improvements to image parsing (find more images and identify them more accurately)
4.  Add `difference()` method for Releases (show images that are in this release but not the other)
5.  Add `check_expected()` method for Releases (check if all 'important' images are present)
6.  **API**: rename `find_task_url()` to `find_task_images()` and make it return all images (not just one)
7.  Add `find_task_urls()` which actually returns URLs
8.  Add a Koji query cache mechanism for `Nightly` instances
9.  Add `koji_done()` and `pungi_done()` properties (for all Releases, but mostly useful for `Nightly`)
10. Parallelize Koji queries using `multiprocessing`

### 1.2 - 2015-07-23

*   [fedfind-1.2.tar.xz](https://www.happyassassin.net/fedfind/releases/fedfind-1.2.tar.xz)

1.  Add a proper logging mechanism
2.  Allow 'Rawhide' as a release value (but, unfortunately, broke `-r NN` in the CLI)

### 1.1.5 - 2015-04-30

*   [fedfind-1.1.5.tar.xz](https://www.happyassassin.net/fedfind/releases/fedfind-1.1.5.tar.xz)

1.  Add a `-g` parameter that prints the 'generic' URL for the given release
2.  Allow `--milestone Branched` and `--milestone Rawhide` (they are never really necessary, but it's not unusual to pass them instinctively, and as we can handle them, better to do so than fail)

### 1.1.4 - 2015-04-23

*   [fedfind-1.1.4.tar.xz](https://www.happyassassin.net/fedfind/releases/fedfind-1.1.4.tar.xz)

1.  Drop shebangs from files that can't be executed, use 'env' in shebangs in files that can be executed, don't specify a python version in shebangs (as fedfind is python version-agnostic)

### 1.1.3 - 2015-04-16

*   [fedfind-1.1.3.tar.xz](https://www.happyassassin.net/fedfind/releases/fedfind-1.1.3.tar.xz)

1.  Drop bundled copy of cached-property, as it's now packaged for Fedora and EPEL (and available from pypi on other platforms)

1.  Update milestone release mirror path: now uses _ not - as separator

### 1.1.1 - 2015-02-26

*   [fedfind-1.1.1.tar.xz](https://www.happyassassin.net/fedfind/releases/fedfind-1.1.1.tar.xz)

3.  Add `version` attribute for `Image` objects

### 1.0.5 - 2015-02-12
