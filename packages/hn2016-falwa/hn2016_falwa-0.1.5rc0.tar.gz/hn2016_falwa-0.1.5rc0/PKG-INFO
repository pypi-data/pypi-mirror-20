Description: 
        hn2016_falwa is a package that contains modules to compute the finite-amplitude 
        local wave activity (FALWA) proposed in Huang and Nakamura (2016 JAS):
        http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0194.1
        The current version of the library handles calculation of FALWA in a spherical 
        barotropic model and QGPV fields on isobaric surfaces.
        
        The functions in this library can compute the tracer equivalent-latitude relationship 
        proposed in Nakamura (1996) (Also, see Allen and Nakamura (2003)) and the (zonal mean)
        finite-amplitude wave activity in spherical geometry as in Nakamura and Solomon (2010).
        
        v0.1.5: A function 'Solve_URef_noslip_hemisphere' has been added. This calculates the reference state introduced in Nakamura and Solomon (2010, JAS) but in a hemispheric domain. Documentations and examples to be uploaded soon.
        v0.1.5b: Include a function 'static_stability' to compute static stability from potential temperature field.
        v0.1.5c: (1) Fixed a bug in outputing equivalent latitude in the function 'qgpv_Eqlat_LWA'. The sign was flipped.
        (2) A beta version of function 'Solve_URef_noslip_hemisphere' is updated. It can only be used to compute eddy-free reference state in no-slip boundary conditions.
