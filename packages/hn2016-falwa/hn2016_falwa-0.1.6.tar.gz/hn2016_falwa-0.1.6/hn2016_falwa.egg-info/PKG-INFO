Description: 
        hn2016_falwa is a package that contains modules to compute the finite-amplitude 
        local wave activity (FALWA) proposed in Huang and Nakamura (2016 JAS):
        http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0194.1
        The current version of the library handles calculation of FALWA in a spherical 
        barotropic model and QGPV fields on isobaric surfaces.
        
        The functions in this library can compute the tracer equivalent-latitude relationship 
        proposed in Nakamura (1996) (Also, see Allen and Nakamura (2003)) and the (zonal mean)
        finite-amplitude wave activity in spherical geometry as in Nakamura and Solomon (2010).
        
        v0.1.6: Included LWA computation subroutines with *prescribed* equivalent latitude profile:
        - barotropic_input_Qref_to_compute_LWA (for barotropic vorticity)
        - qgpv_input_Qref_to_compute_LWA (for QGPV)
