        oneID Connect
        =============
        oneID-connect is a Python authentication framework for the Internet of Things (IoT),
        servers and end-users. By sending messages with digital signatures, you can authenticate
        the origin of the message and ensure the message hasn't been tampered with.
        oneID-connect makes it simple for projects that need to securely send messages and verify
        the authentication of messages.

        Building the API Docs Locally
        =============================
        oneid-connect-python uses Sphinx to create documentation. Following these instructions builds the docs locally and outputs them to ``./docs/_build/html``.
        You may not need a python virtual environment if python is installed universally on your machine.
        
        #. Create a virtualenv in oneid-connect-python.
        #. To install requirements, run ``pip install -r requirements.txt -r docs_requirements.txt`` to install all requirements defined in the repo. This should install sphinx, sphinx_rtd_theme, and more.
        #. From the project dir, run ``sphinx-build -b html ./docs ./docs/_build`` OR from ./docs, run ``make html``
        #. Run ``make clean`` from ./docs to remove the build.
