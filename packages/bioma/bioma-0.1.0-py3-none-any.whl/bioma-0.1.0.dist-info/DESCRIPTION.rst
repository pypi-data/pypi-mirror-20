bioma is a bio-related data manager, designed to ease
the storage, manipulation and exchange of information
in scientific research. The system is built on top of
graph databases and web semantics techniques, that
differently from conventional relational databases
allows adaptive growth of datasets, unconstrained by a
previously defined data structure. Querying algorithms
and a simplistic data representation (easily exported)
are also included in the package.
