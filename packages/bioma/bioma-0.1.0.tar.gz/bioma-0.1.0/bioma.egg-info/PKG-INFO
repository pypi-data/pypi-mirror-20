Description: bioma is a bio-related data manager, designed to ease
                                the storage, manipulation and exchange of information
                                in scientific research. The system is built on top of
                                graph databases and web semantics techniques, that
                                differently from conventional relational databases
                                allows adaptive growth of datasets, unconstrained by a
                                previously defined data structure. Querying algorithms
                                and a simplistic data representation (easily exported)
                                are also included in the package.
