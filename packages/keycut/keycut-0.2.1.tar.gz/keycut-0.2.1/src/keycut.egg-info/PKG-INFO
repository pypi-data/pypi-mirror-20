        Helper tool to show and search shortcuts for your favorite programs.
        
        KeyCut (for keyboard shortcut) is a command line tool
        that helps you remembering the numerous keyboard shortcuts
        of your favorite programs, both graphical and command line ones,
        by allowing you to print them quickly in a console and search through them.
        
        Shortcut data are provided by the `keycut-data`_ repository.
        
        This repo contains the sources for a Python implementation of KeyCut.
        
        It looks like this

        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            [sudo -H] pip install keycut
        
        You will also need to download the data by cloning the repository somewhere:
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/Pawamoy/keycut-data keycut_data
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The program needs to know where the data are. By default, it will search
        in the (relative) `keycut-data/default` directory.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            export KEYCUT_DATA=/somewhere/keycut_data/default
        
        Show all bash shortcuts:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            keycut bash
        
        Show all bash shortcuts matching *proc* (in Category, Action, or Keys):
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            keycut bash proc
