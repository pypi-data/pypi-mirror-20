Installation
------------

::

  python3 -m pip install gidgethub


Goals
-----

The key goal is to provide a base library for the
`GitHub API <https://developer.github.com/>`_ which performs no I/O of its own (a
`sans-I/O <https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/>`_ library). This allows users to
choose whatever HTTP library they prefer while parceling out GitHub-specific
details to this library. This base library is then built upon to provide an
abstract base class to a cleaner API to work with. Finally, implementations of
the abstract base class are provided for asynchronous HTTP libraries for
immediate usage.


Alternative libraries
---------------------

If you think you want a different approach to the GitHub API,
`GitHub maintains a list of libraries <https://developer.github.com/libraries/>`_.


*Aside*: what's with the name?
------------------------------

I couldn't think of a good name that was somehow a play on "GitHub" or somehow
tied into `Monty Python <http://www.montypython.com/>`_. And so I decided to play
off of GitHub's `octocat <https://octodex.github.com/>`_ as a theme and use my
cat's name, Gidget, as part of the name. Since "Gidget" somewhat sounds like
"git", I decided to go with "gidgethub".
