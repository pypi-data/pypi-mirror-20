        #######################################
        
        What is this?
        =============
        
        This project is about creating a custom logger with a few arguments such as logger name and file path (if FileHandler is used).
        
        
        Why was this made?
        ==================
        
        In the python projects I have worked with (work or personal projects), I have always had to create a logging instance with a FileHandler, provide a logging format, provide logging file name (and create directories if need be), which is extremely frustrating, at the least. So I decided to encapsulate the pain points regarding the aforementioned.
        
        
        
        How do I use this?
        ==================
        
        - Importing package
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from lumberjack import Lumberjack
        
            # outputs logs in the console.
            logger = Lumberjack(name="lumberjack")
        
            # outputs logs in the filename 'logs/lumberjack_<timestamp>.log'
            logger = Lumberjack(name="lumberjack", file_name="logs/lumberjack.log")
        
        
        - Calling ``.info(...)``
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            logger.info('Live long and prosper, hoomans')
        
            # Log info output
            2017-02-23 20:31:41,932 - lumberjack - INFO - Live long and prosper, hoomans!
        
        - Calling ``.debug(...)``
        .. code-block:: python
        
            logger.debug('NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!')
        
            # Log debug output
            2017-02-24 04:08:11,265 - lumberjack - DEBUG - NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
        
        - Calling ``.log(...)``
        .. code-block:: python
        
            logger.log(50, 'This is DEFCON level 50')
        
            # Log output
            2017-02-24 04:33:22,869 - lumberjack - CRITICAL - This is DEFCON level 50
        
            logger.log(500, 'Deez notes were demonetized in India')
        
            # Log output
            2017-02-24 04:33:48,558 - lumberjack - Level 500 - Deez notes were demonetized in India
        
            logger.log('This is DEFCON level 999?')
        
            # Log output
            2017-02-24 04:33:13,615 - lumberjack - Level 999 - This is DEFCON level 999?
        
        
        Can I contribute to this?
        =========================
        
        Sure! Create an issue in the repo if it's not already present. Then fork this repo, branch off from `master`, add a feature / push a fix and raise a pull-request. I'll merge it once I deem it useful.
