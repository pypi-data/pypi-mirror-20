### How it works

Voodoo leverage Docker-compose and  [Anybox's buildout](http://pythonhosted.org/anybox.recipe.openerp/) for odoo.

In your __host__ run __voodoo__ commands to bootstrap the project and launch docker.

Then in your __guest__ (container), run __ak__ commands to update odoo dependencies (odoo modules), trigger update scripts and restart odoo server.
