	from facebook import webhook

then create a new Verify Token; It can be alphanumeric. And store it in a variable named.

	Token="user generated token"

Now, add anothers lines to the script

	PORT = int(os.environ.get('PORT', '5000'))
	webhook.startServer(Verify_Token=Token,port=PORT)


Tip:
