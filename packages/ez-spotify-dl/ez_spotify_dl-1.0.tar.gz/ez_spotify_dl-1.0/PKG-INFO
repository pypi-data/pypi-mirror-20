        =============
        
        Don't you think would be cool if you could donwload your playlists from your Spotify account, don't you?
        So, the **Ez Spotify DL** can do that for you. Plus, in an easy way.
        
        
        
        ## Install
        
        Assuming that you have *pip* installed, open the console/terminal execute:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install ez-spotify-dl
        ```
        
        use --user flag if you don't want to install on system-wide mode
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install --user ez-spotify-dl
        ```
        or download/clone the package, go to project folder and
        
        ```bash
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        as the same as using pip you can insert the --user flag
