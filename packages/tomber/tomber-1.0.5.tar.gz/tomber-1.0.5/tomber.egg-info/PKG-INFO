        =========
        
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        Tomber is a python wrapper for [Tomb](https://github.com/dyne/Tomb).
        It relies on Python's subprocess module for Tomb command
        execution. This project was inspired by pytomb which was included in
        Tomb ./extras in the past but is no longer maintained.
        
        The included test.jpg image file is used to test the `tbury()` and
        `texhume()` functions.
        
        To speedup forge, an entropy generator such as
        [haveged](http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/) can be installed.
        
        
        Compatibity
        ----------
        
        Current version requieres at least Tomb v2.2 to run.
        If for any reason you need to use older Tomb version with tomber, please
        install tomber v1.0.2
        
        
        Installation
        ----------
        
        First, Tomb must be installed. Please refer to the
        [Tomb documentation](https://github.com/dyne/Tomb/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
        to get Tomb installed on your system.
        
        Second, tomber must be installed. Tomber can be installed from
        [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) using
        [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). Enter the following command
        into terminal:
        
        	pip install tomber
        
        Alternatively you can clone this public repository by entering the following
        command into terminal.
        
        	git clone https://github.com/reiven/tomber
        
        
        Example usage
        -------------
        ```python
        from tomber import *
        
        # dig a tomb of 20mb
        tdig('test.tomb',20)
        
        # forge a key
        tforge('test.key', 'this is the passphrase for the key')
        
        # lock the tomb
        tlock('test.tomb', 'test.key', 'this is the passphrase for the key')
        
        # open the tomb
        topen('test.tomb', 'test.key', 'this is the passphrase for the key', '/tmp/tomb')
        
        # close the tomb
        tclose('test')
        ```
        
        Running tests
        -------------
        
        Keep in mind that the included *test.py* file execute the
        `Tomb.slam()` command which will likely close any tombs, encrypted
        volumes, you may have open.
