Package Structure
-----------------

-  **test\_vert**: Unit tests for vert

   -  **test\_stores**: Unit tests for vert.stores

      -  **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Empty placeholder.
      -  **\_base.py**: Contains base class for vert.stores test cases.
      -  **test\_dbm.py**: Unit tests for vert.stores.dbm.
      -  **test\_memory.py**: Unit tests for vert.stores.memory.

   -  **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Empty placeholder.

-  **vert**: The package root

   -  **stores**: Subpackage containing implementations of various graph
      stores that the vert package supports out of the box.

      -  **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Empty placeholder.
      -  **base.py**: Defines the GraphStore interface that all graph
         stores have to implement. The GraphStore interface hides the
         implementation details for each graph store, providing a
         consistent, albeit clunky, means of accessing and modifying the
         contents of a graph.
      -  **dbm.py**: Defines DBMGraphStore, a DBM-backed persistent
         graph store.
      -  **memory.py**: Defines the MemoryGraphStore, a non-persistent,
         memory-only graph store.

   -  **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Exports the publicly visible symbols for the
      vert package. Nothing is actually defined in this module.
   -  **graphs.py**: Defines the Graph, Vertex, and Edge, classes, along
      with other supporting infrastructure. This module's classes
      transform the clunky interface provided by GraphStore into a
      convenient and versatile object-oriented interface designed to
      make it easy to work with graphs in a consistent manner regardless
      of how the underlying storage mechanisms work.

Examples
--------

Non-Persistent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    from vert import Graph

    with Graph() as g:
        dog = g.vertices['dog'].add()
        cat = g.vertices['cat'].add()
        edge = g.edges['dog', 'cat']
        print(edge.exists)  # False
        edge.add()
        print(edge.exists)  # True
        edge.labels.add('chases')
        print('chases' in edge.labels)  # True

    with Graph() as g:
        edge = g.edges['dog', 'cat']
        print(edge.exists)  # False 

DBM-Backed Persistence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    from vert import Graph

    with Graph('test.db') as g:
        dog = g.vertices['dog'].add()
        cat = g.vertices['cat'].add()
        edge = g.edges['dog', 'cat']
        print(edge.exists)  # False
        edge.add()
        print(edge.exists)  # True
        edge.labels.add('chases')
        print('chases' in edge.labels)  # True

    with Graph('test.db') as g:
        edge = g.edges['dog', 'cat']
        print(edge.exists)  # Still true
        print('chases' in edge.labels)  # Still true

Defining Your Own Storage Mechanism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    from vert import Graph, GraphStore

    class MyGraphStore(GraphStore):
        # Implement each of GraphStore's abstract methods here
        ...
        
    with Graph(MyGraphStore(...)) as g:
        # Now the graph consults your back end for storage and retrieval
        ...

TODO:
-----

-  Add separately installable graph stores for neo4j, tinkerpop,
   networkx, sqlite, and other back ends.
-  Add an example for creating a third-party module to provide support
   for new kinds of graph stores.
-  Add algorithms such as path finding and pattern matching. Whenever
   possible, these should be implemented by the graph store, rather than
   at the interface level. By having the interface classes inspect the
   graph store for the method before calling it, it should be possible
   to fall back on a slower default client-side implementation when the
   store does not provide one. An alternate approach would be to add the
   methods to the GraphStore class but have them raise a special
   sentinel exception if the particular implementation doesn't provide
   the algorithm.
-  Add support for transactions and make the code thread-safe.
-  Add support for reading & writing common graph file formats.
-  Add support for transferring from one graph store to another.
-  100% code coverage for unit testing.
-  Prettify the string representations for Edges and Vertices.
-  Make the DBM graph store more efficient.
-  Add proper documentation strings.
-  Add an intro to the README file.
-  Support older versions of Python.
