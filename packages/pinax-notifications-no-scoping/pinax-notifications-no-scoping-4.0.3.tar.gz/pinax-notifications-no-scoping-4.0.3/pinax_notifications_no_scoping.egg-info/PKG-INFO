        Pinax
        ------
        
        Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates. 
        This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.
        
        This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.
        
        
        pinax-notifications
        --------------------
        
        ``pinax-notifications`` is a user notification management app for the Django web framework. 
        Many sites need to notify users when certain events have occurred and to allow
        configurable options as to how those notifications are to be received.
        
        
        Features
        ---------
        
        The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality. This
        includes:
        
        * Submission of notification messages by other apps
        * Notification messages on signing in
        * Notification messages via email (configurable by user)
        * Ability to supply your own backends notification channels
        
        
        History
        ---------
        This app was originally named `django-notification` but was renamed to
        bring a common package name like `notification` under the `pinax` namespace
        to avoid conflicts with other like named packages.
        
        In addition, we wanted to take the opportunity to rename it to the plural
        form, `notifications` to be in line with the convention we've adopted
        across the ecosystem.
