	<p i18n:translate="">You have decided to transform an idea into a proposal.</p>

	<p i18n:translate="">In order for other users to have a fast overview of your proposal, you must provide a summary of it.</p>

	<p i18n:translate="">To complement your proposal, you can use a rich text editor, which enables you to integrate any form of content (image, video, table, link).</p>

	<p i18n:translate="">You can also re-use other existing ideas on the platform, select text elements from them and drag-and-drop them into your proposal, or also write down your new ideas, which you will be able to re-work upon later.</p>
