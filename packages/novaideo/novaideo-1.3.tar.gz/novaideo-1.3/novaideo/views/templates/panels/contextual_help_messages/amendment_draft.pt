   <p i18n:translate="">You have created a new, modified version of the proposal. It is in a private status and you are the only one able to see it.</p>

   <p i18n:translate="">The text elements that you have added appear in green. Those that you have deleted appear in red. For your improvements to be submitted as amendments to the other participants, you must previously have explained them and regrouped them into amendments.</p>

   <p i18n:translate="">If you are not happy with your modified version, you can delete it, modify it or duplicate it. In the latter case, you will access a copy of the modified version, while keeping this modified version unchanged.</p>
