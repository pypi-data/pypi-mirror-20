		As an Examiner, you can express your opinion on a proposal.
	</p>
	<p i18n:translate="">
		This opinion can be either positive, negative or "To be re-worked upon".
	</p>
	<p i18n:translate="">
		To complement this opinion, you must evaluate the proposal along three criteria:"Internal or customer impact", "Feasibility" and "Reproductibility and frequency of occurence", and explain this evaluation.
	</p>
	<p i18n:translate="">
		A positive opinion means that the Examination Committee is ready to implement it. "To be re-worked upon" that it is interesting, but deserves being re-worked upon. A negative opinion means that it will not be further considered.
