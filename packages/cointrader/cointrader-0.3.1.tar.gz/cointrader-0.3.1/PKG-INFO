        .. danger::
        
                You could loose money. Use cointrader at your own risk! I do not
                accept any responsibility for any losses.
        
                Cointrader is Alpha quality! Cointrader is in a early development
                phase. Expect all all aspects of the application to change in the
                future. Cointrader is not roundly tested. It's default trading
                strategy currently performs worse than the market in in most
                situations.

        Motivation
        ----------
        This program exists because I want to learn more about automatic trading
        based on a technical analysis of charts.
        I am no expert on trading or crypto currencies! I am a professional
        Python programmer who stuck his nose into the crypto coin and trading world in
        2017 and who was directly fascinated on this topic. After reading some books
        on technical analysis I decided to write this program to learn more about
        how automatic trading works.

        History
        =======
        
        0.3.1 (2017-03-11)
        ------------------
        Bugfix release.
        
        * Fixed issue #4 (https://github.com/toirl/cointrader/issues/4)
          - Use absolute imports.
          - Renamed contrader modul into bot to prevent namespace issues.
          - Added missing requirement of the 'requests' package.
        
        0.3.0 (2017-03-02)
        ------------------
        * Added backtest functionality. Cointrader can simulate trading in
          backtest mode. In this mode the trade is done on historic chart data. This
          is useful to check the performance of your trading strategy. Please note
          that the backtest is not 100% accurate as buy and sell prices are based on the
          closing price of the currency. This is idealistic and will not reflect the
          whole market situation.
        * Added new "exchange" command. Can be used to calculate how many BTC you get
          for a certain amount of USD.
        
        0.2.0 (2017-02-26)
        ------------------
        
        * Improved "Usage" documentation
        * Changed format of confiuration file from JSON to standard python
          configuration file (.ini)
        * Added "balance" command
        * Added "explore" command
        
        0.1.0 (2017-02-21)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI
