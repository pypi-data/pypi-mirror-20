Backtesting
===========

Backtesting is the act of testing a strategy on real chart data from the past.
This can be used to measure the performance of your trading strategy in
comparison to the market.

Doing backtests with cointrader is easy by setting the `backtest` flag::

        cointrader start --backtest --automatic --timeframe 1d --resolution 5m BTC_DASH 0.05                                                                            2.MÃ¤r.17 23.21

Despite of this single flag the bot will work as usual. It will trade on the
given market for the defined timeframe and resolution. After the backtest has
finished a small statistic on this trading run is shown::
