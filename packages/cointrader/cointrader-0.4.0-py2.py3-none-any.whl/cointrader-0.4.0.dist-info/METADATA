Cointrader is Python based CLI trading application for crypto currencies on
the Poloniex_ exchange.  Cointrader can be used for semiautomatic guided
trading.

.. danger::

        You could loose money. Use cointrader at your own risk! I do not
        accept any responsibility for any losses.

        Cointrader is Alpha quality! It is not meant to be used for serious
        trading yet. It is still in a early development phase and has a bunch
        full of known defects. Expect all all aspects of the application to
        change in the future. Cointrader is not roundly tested.

        If you want to help cointrader the best Free Software trading bot your

        in the `documentation <http://cointrader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_.

Motivation
----------
This program exists because I want to learn more about automatic trading
based on a technical analysis of charts.
I am no expert on trading or crypto currencies! I am a professional
Python programmer who stuck his nose into the crypto coin and trading world in
2017 and who was directly fascinated on this topic. After reading some books
on technical analysis I decided to write this program to learn more about
how automatic trading works.

=======
History
=======

0.4.0 (2017-03-16)
------------------
First version with real trading functionality. However **cointrader has no
working trading strategy yet**. So the default strategy will do nothing than
waiting :). However you can use the interactive mode to buy and sell coins if
you want to.

* Added automatic trading. Cointrader will follow the emitted signals from the
  strategy.
* Added Papertrading. Do trading without any risk. Cointrader will simulate
  trading.
* Added Tradelog.

0.3.1 (2017-03-11)
------------------
Bugfix release.

* Fixed issue #4 (https://github.com/toirl/cointrader/issues/4)
  - Use absolute imports.
  - Renamed contrader modul into bot to prevent namespace issues.
  - Added missing requirement of the 'requests' package.

0.3.0 (2017-03-02)
------------------
* Added backtest functionality. Cointrader can simulate trading in
  backtest mode. In this mode the trade is done on historic chart data. This
  is useful to check the performance of your trading strategy. Please note
  that the backtest is not 100% accurate as buy and sell prices are based on the
  closing price of the currency. This is idealistic and will not reflect the
  whole market situation.
* Added new "exchange" command. Can be used to calculate how many BTC you get
  for a certain amount of USD.

0.2.0 (2017-02-26)
------------------

* Improved "Usage" documentation
* Changed format of configuration file from JSON to standard python
  configuration file (.ini)
* Added "balance" command
* Added "explore" command

0.1.0 (2017-02-21)
------------------

* First release on PyPI
