"""This sub-package handle writers for PyRETIS data.

Writers are basically formatting the data created from PyRETIS.
The writers also have some additional functionality and can be used to
load data written by PyRETIS as well. This is used when analysing
the output from a PyRETIS simulation.

Package structure
-----------------

Modules

fileio.py (:py:mod:`pyretis.inout.writers.fileio`)
    Module defining a class for handling writing of files.

gromacsio.py (:py:mod:`pyretis.inout.writers.gromacsio`)
    Module defining some io methods for use with GROMACS.

__init__.py
    This file.

pathfile.py (:py:mod:`pyretis.inout.writers.pathfile`)
    Module for handling path data and path-ensemble data.

tablewriter.py (:py:mod:`pyretis.inout.writers.tablewriter`)
    Module defining generic methods for creating text tables.

txtinout.py (:py:mod:`pyretis.inout.writers.txtinout`)
    Module defining some text based output.

writers.py (:py:mod:`pyretis.inout.writers.writers`)
    Module for defining the base writer and some simple derived writers
    (for crossing data, energy and order parameter data).

Important methods defined in this package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

get_writer (:py:func:`.get_writer`)
    Opens a file for reading given a file type and file name.

Important classes defined in this package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    """Return a file object which can be used for loading files.

    This is a convenience function to return an instance of a `Writer`
    or derived classes so that we are ready to read data from that file.
    Usage is intended to be in cases when we just want to open a file
    easily. The returned object can then be used to read the file
    using `load(filename)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_type : string
        The desired file type
    settings : dict
        A dict of settings we might need to pass for to the writer.
        This can for instance be the units for a trajectory writer.

    Returns
    -------
    out : object like :py:class:`.Writer`
        An object which implements the `load(filename)` method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pyretis.inout.writers import get_writer
    >>> crossfile = get_writer('cross')
    >>> print(crossfile)
    >>> for block in crossfile.load('cross.dat'):
    >>>     print(len(block['data']))
