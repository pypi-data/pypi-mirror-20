Description: plex-lastfm-scrobbler
        =====================
        
        |Build Status|
        
        plex-lastfm-scrobbler provides a set of scripts that allow you to
        scrobble played audio items to Last.FM from the Plex Media Server
        application. plex-lastfm-scrobbler was built to run across platforms,
        though only tested on Linux.
        
        A few points
        
        -  plex-lastfm-scrobbler is an out of process tool. Meaning it is not a
           Plex Media Server plug-in. This tool runs separately of your Plex
           Media Server.
        -  Must be run on the Plex Media Server
        -  Parses Plex Media Server logs for the 'got played' string in the log
           file.
        -  Does not differentiate between clients. Meaning all media played,
           will be scrobbled while the script is running.
        -  Your plex-media-server logs must be set at DEBUG level (not VERBOSE)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **Linux, OSX**
        
        It is recommended (but not required) that you install this into a
        virtualenvironment. This can be done as such.
        
        ::
        
            virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/plex-lastfm-scrobbler
            source ~/.virtualenvs/plex-lastfm-scrobbler/bin/activate
        
        Installing via ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` is supported. For example
        :``pip install plex-scrobble`` or ``easy_install plex-scrobble``.
        
        If you wish to run development builds, fetch and install the source from
        the github repo.
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/jesseward/plex-lastfm-scrobbler.git
            cd plex-lastfm-scrobbler
            python setup.py install
            pip install -r dev_requirements.txt # for mock/testing packages.
        
        Alternatively, you can fetch the latest zip from github
        
        ::
        
            wget https://github.com/jesseward/plex-lastfm-scrobbler/archive/master.zip
            unzip master.zip
            cd plex-lastfm-scrobbler-master
            python setup.py install
        
        You're done.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Run the wizard to generate config file
        
        ::
        
            plex-scrobble --wizard
        
        The plex-lastfm-scrobbler configuration file (.plex-scrobble.toml) is
        installed to ~/ . The following configuration values are available.
        
        If you're running Plex Media Server on a Linux based operating system,
        things should work out of the box.
        
        ::
        
            [lastfm]
            # REQUIRED: You'll need to create a last.fm API application first. Do so here:
            # http://www.last.fm/api/account/create
            api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
            api_secret = "YOUR_API_SECRET"
            user_name = "LAST_FM_USERNAME"
            password = "LAST_FM_PASSWORD"
        
            [plex-scrobble]
            # mediaserver_log_location references the log file location of the plex media server
            # the default under /var/lib/... is the default install of plex media server on
            # a Linux system. You may wish to change this value to reference your OS install.
            # https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250417-Plex-Media-Server-Log-Files
            mediaserver_log_location = "/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Logs/Plex Media Server.log"
        
            # REQUIRED: Where do you wish to write the plex-scrobble log file.
            log_file = "/tmp/plex-scrobble.log"
        
            # REQUIRED: mediaserver_url is the location of the http service exposed by Plex Media Server
            # the default values should be 'ok', assuming you're running the plex scrobble
            # script from the same server as your plex media server
            mediaserver_url = "http://localhost:32400"
        
            # REQUIRED: a python data struture that stores failed scrobbles. plex-scrobble
            # will retry on a 60 minute interval, maximum of 10 attempts if last.fm is
            # experiencing issues.
            cache_location = "/tmp/plex_scrobble.cache"
        
            # OPTIONAL: plex_token defines the plex token used to get metadata
            # Note: This is required if you use localhost or 127.0.0.1 and Plex Media Server >= 1.1.0
            # You will know if you see a line like this your log_file:
            # [plex_scrobble.plex_monitor fetch_metadata] [ERROR] urllib2 error reading from http://localhost:32400/library/metadata/48080 'HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized'
            # Here is how you can obtain your token https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204059436-Finding-your-account-token-X-Plex-Token
            plex_token = "YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN"
        
        Running
        -------
        
        If you installed plex-lastfm-scrobble to a virtual environment, enable
        the virtual env.
        
        ::
        
            source ~/.virtualenvs/plex-lastfm-scrobber/bin/activate
        
        run the application
        
        ::
        
            nohup plex-scrobble &
        
        Troubleshooting & Known Issues
        ------------------------------
        
        -  If your Plex client supports the universal transcoder (see "Old and
           Universal transcoder @
           https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250377-Transcoding-Media),
           tracks will be scrobbled at the start of play. This is due to the way
           that the universal transcoder writes to the Plex log file. See issue
           11 (https://github.com/jesseward/plex-lastfm-scrobbler/issues/11) for
           background discussion.
        -  We've seen instances when Plex Media Server does not report the
           length of an audio file. This may occur before a full library analyze
           has completed. When the track length is not reported by the Plex
           Media Server, the song will not be scrobble. Try forcing the
           "Analyze" audio library function. Further discussion found in issue
           #9 https://github.com/jesseward/plex-lastfm-scrobbler/issues/9
