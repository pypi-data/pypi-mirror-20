Requirements
============

Both of these scripts depend on the jsonpickle library which can be installed using pip. This tool is used to generate json files are used to store device state information for reporting.

Normalizer
==========

This example version of a Normalizer will connect to a defined set of routers. It will validate the configuration (in this case, the presence of ip access-list standard trigger-test-1), and effect a change to the device if required.

Here is the result of two executions against a set of three routers, one of which requires normalization and one of which is offline. There is a third execution where a specific router is specified on the command line. By default all routers in test-units.csv will be processed.

.. code::

    johnf@pstanadm1:~/TriggerOpen$ ./Normalize.py
    Processing all sites
    Are you certain you want to normalize 3 devices? [y/N]
    y
    Processing 3 devices (r1 r2 r3)
    Failed to ping host r1
    Validating router details
    r2: Will normalized trigger-test acl on device
    Normalizing 1 devices (r2)
    Device r2: Configuration Saved
    johnf@pstanadm1:~/TriggerOpen$ ./Normalize.py r2
    Processing 1 devices (r2)
    Validating router details
    No devices need to be normalized


Report
======

This example of a reporting tool reports on the IOS version of devices. If you run it without specifing a device it will connect to all devices in test-units.csv. If you specify devices it will only connect to them. The report.csv file that it creates also indicates when the device was last contacted.

.. code::

    johnf@pstanadm1:~/TriggerOpen$ ./Report.py 
    Processing all sites
    Failed to ping host r1
    johnf@pstanadm1:~/TriggerOpen$ cat report.csv 
    Device,Last Access,Version
    r1,Never,Unknown
    r2,2015-08-20 09:00,15.2(4)M6
    r3,2015-08-20 09:00,15.2(4)M6
    johnf@pstanadm1:~/TriggerOpen$ ./Report.py r2
    johnf@pstanadm1:~/TriggerOpen$ cat report.csv 
    Device,Last Access,Version
    r1,Never,Unknown
    r2,2015-08-20 09:01,15.2(4)M6
    r3,2015-08-20 09:00,15.2(4)M6


ToDo
====

+ Support for device name globbing
+ Place command execution results into an ordered list
