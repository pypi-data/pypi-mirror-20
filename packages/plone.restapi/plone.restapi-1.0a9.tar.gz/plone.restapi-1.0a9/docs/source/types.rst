Types
=====

Available content types in a Plone site can be listed and queried by accessing the ``/@types`` endpoint on portal root (requires an authenticated user):

.. note::
	These docs are generated by code tests, therefore you will see some 'test' contenttypes appear here.

.. literalinclude:: _json/types.json
   :language: js

To get the schema of a content type, access the ``/@types`` endpoint  with the name of the content type, e.g. '/plone/@types/Document':

.. literalinclude:: _json/types_document.json
   :language: js

The content type schema uses the `JSON Schema <http://json-schema.org/>`_ format.

See :ref:`types-schema` for a detailed documentation about the available field types.
