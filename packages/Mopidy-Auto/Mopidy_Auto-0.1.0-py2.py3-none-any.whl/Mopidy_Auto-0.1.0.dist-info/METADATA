Mopidy plugin to automate music playback.

Can be used in restaurants to play fitting music depending on time of day with no user input required.

Only tested with *file* backend.

Consists of a frontend and simple web client.

Frontend
========

If no tracks are playing and a play event is received, or if playback ends, a random album will be added to the
tracklist and playback started.

Album is chosen from one of 3 sections, based on time of day. After an album has been played, it will not play again
until all other albums in it's section has been played.

If volume is set higher than what is configured for the section, it will be lowered before playback starts.

Web Client
==========

The web client is reached on url `/auto/`. It shows which track, artist and album is playing.

It has 2 buttons: **Play / Pause** and **Skip to next track**.

It also has a volume control.
