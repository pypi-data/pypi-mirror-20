pymods |Build Status|
=====================

pymods is utility module for working with the Library of Congress's MODS
XML standard: Metadata Description Schema (MODS). It is a utility
wrapper for the lxml module specific to deserializing data out of
MODSXML into python data types.

If you need a module to serialize data into MODSXML, see the other
`pymods by Matt Cordial`_.

Installing
----------

Recommended:

``pip install pymods``

Using
-----

Basics
~~~~~~

XML is parsed using either the MODS or OAI class:

``mods_records = MODS('some_file.xml')``

``oai_records = OAI('some_file.xml')``

Individual records are stored at the MODS or OAI object in the
record\_list attribute. These records can be called individually by
index number or used as an iterator.

.. code:: python

    for record in mods_records.record_list:
       print(MODS.rights(record))

.. code:: python

    print(MODS.rights(oai_records.record_list[3]))

MODS
^^^^

The MODS class parses records at each ``mods:mods`` element. It will
work with ``mods:modsCollection`` documents, outputs from OAI-PMH feeds,
or individual MODSXML documents with ``mods:mods`` as the root element.

When parsing only a single record, the MODS and OAI classes will still
store the record in the record\_list attribute. Accessing the record
will still require calling the object as an iterator or by list index.

OAI
^^^

The OAI class can be used with the output from OAI-PMH feeds or repox
exports. ``oai_dc:record`` elements are parsed as the record root
elements in documents in the oai\_dc namespace. Documents in the repox
namespace are parsed using ``repox:record`` as the record root element.

Methods
~~~~~~~

All functions return data either as a string, list, or dict. See the
appropriate docstrings for details.

FSUDL
~~~~~

Methods in the FSUDL class are helper functions specific to Florida
State University's `DigiNole`_ and might not apply to records from other
sources.

Examples
--------

Importing

.. code:: python

    from pymods import MODS, FSUDL, OAI

Parsing a file

.. code:: python

    >>> mods = MODS('example.xml')

    >>> len(mods.record_list)
    3
