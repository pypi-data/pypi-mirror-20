Ripy is a small project aiming to allow easy access to refractive index information on materials. Besides basic objects representing materials, bindings to various databases are provided. Currently the following databases are supported:

* The *http://refractiveindex.info/* database
* Exports from PV Lighthouse (experimental)

More databases will be added in the future if needed.
