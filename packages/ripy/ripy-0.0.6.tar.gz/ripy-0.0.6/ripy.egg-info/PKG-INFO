Description: Ripy is a small project aiming to allow easy access to refractive index information on materials. Besides basic objects representing materials, bindings to various databases are provided. Currently the following databases are supported:
        
        * The *http://refractiveindex.info/* database
        * Exports from PV Lighthouse (experimental)
        
        More databases will be added in the future if needed.
        
        * Change of sign in complex refractive index (convention)
