Description: ================
        Welcome to Abed!
        ================
        
        Abed is an automated system for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It 
        is created for running experiments where it is desired to run multiple methods 
        on multiple datasets using multiple parameters. It includes automated 
        processing of result files into result tables. Abed was designed for use 
        with the Dutch LISA supercomputer, but can hopefully be used on any Torque 
        compute cluster.
        
        Abed was created as a way to automate all the tedious work necessary to set 
        up proper benchmarking experiments. It also removes much of the hassle by 
        using a single configuration file for the experimental setup. A core feature 
        of Abed is that it doesn't care about which language the tested methods are 
        written in.
        
        Abed can create output tables as either simple txt files, or as html pages 
        using the excellent `DataTables <https://datatables.net/>`_ plugin. To support 
        offline operation the necessary DataTables files are packaged with Abed.

        Notes
        -----
        
        The current version of Abed is very usable. However, it is still considered 
        beta software, as it is not yet completely documented and some robustness 
        improvements are planned. For a similar and more mature project which works 
        with R see: `BatchExperiments <https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchExperiments>`_.
