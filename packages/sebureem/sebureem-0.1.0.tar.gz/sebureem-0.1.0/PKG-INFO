        Sebureem
        ########
        
        Sebureem is a small comment server written in Python 3 with the Flask
        microframework and the Peewee ORM.
        Comments are storred using the SQLite database.
        
        Sebureem is the Kotava word for "comments" or "group of comments".
        
        **Important : Sebureem is still in very early stage. It might not be secure and
        a lot of rough edges are to be expected.**
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        First run:
        
        ``pip install sebureem``
        
        Create database :
        
        ``sebureem database --init``
        
        Then run your sebureem instance with :
        
        ``sebureem serve``
        
        â€¦ or you can specify host and port :
        
        ``sebureem serve 0.0.0.0 8000``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Just add an iframe containing the following code in your page::
        
            <iframe src="http://<server_url:port>/comments/<topic>" >
                <p>Your browser doesn't support iframes. Comments can't be loaded.</p>
            </iframe>
        
        where server_url and port are the address of your instance and topic is the name
        of the discussion thread you want to add to your webpage.
        
        If the thread doesn't exist in the database it will be created with the first
        comment.
