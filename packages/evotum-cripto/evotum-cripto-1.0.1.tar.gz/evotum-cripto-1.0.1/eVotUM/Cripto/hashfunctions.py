"""
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to
data of fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values,
hash codes or simply hashes.

A cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input data maps
to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult
to reconstruct it (or equivalent alternatives) by knowing the stored hash value. This
is used for assuring integrity of transmitted data, and is the building block for
HMACs, which provide message authentication.

Some standard applications that employ hash functions include authentication, message
integrity, message fingerprinting, data corruption detection, and digital signature
efficiency.
