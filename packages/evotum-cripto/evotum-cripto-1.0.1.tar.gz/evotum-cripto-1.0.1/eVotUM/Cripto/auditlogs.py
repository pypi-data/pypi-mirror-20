"""
A log is perhaps the simplest possible storage abstraction. It is an append-only,
totally-ordered sequence of records/entries ordered by time that have a specific
purpose: to record what happened and when.
Logs are usually kept in log files or databases. In the event that an attacker access
the log, it's necessary to limit his ability to corrupt the log entries.

The following functions can be used to generate a SHA256 hash (and verify it) for
each log entry, being that each log entry allows to verify that the previous log
entries were not compromised. So it's possible to guarantee that if an attacker
compromises the log entries, modifying, destroying or creating a new entry,
it can be easily detected/verified and audited.

An auditable log is a sequence of log entries represented by 'log entry N - hash1 N'
where:
  * log entry N - Nth log entry
  * hash1 N - HMAC-SHA256(secret key, ( SHA256 (log entry N) + (hash 1 (N - 1)) )
  * + - concatenation
For N == 1 (first log entry), hash 1 (N-1) == "" (empty)

Important: the secret key MUST NOT be stored in the same place as the log entries.
