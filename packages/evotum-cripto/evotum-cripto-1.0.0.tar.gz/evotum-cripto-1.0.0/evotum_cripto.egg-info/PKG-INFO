        eVotUM.Cripto setup
        
        A. Before installing the required python modules (see requirements.txt), please make
        sure that the following dependencies have been installed:
        
        For Debian and Ubuntu, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:
        $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
        
        For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:
        $ sudo yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel
        
        
        B. Since random numbers are generated using eVotUM.Cripto and several systems are not able
        to generate the necessary entropy (especially in Shamir Secret Sharing functions)
        for /dev/random, please install haveged (http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/index.html)
        before running eVotUM.Cripto.
        
        For Debian and Ubuntu, the following command will ensure that haveged is installed:
        $ sudo apt-get install haveged
        
        For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, the following command will ensure that haveged is installed:
        $ sudo yum install haveged
        
        
        C. To install the eVotUM.Cripto python module, please follow the following steps:
