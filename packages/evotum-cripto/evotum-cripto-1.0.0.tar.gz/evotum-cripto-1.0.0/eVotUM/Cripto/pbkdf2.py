"""
PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function (SHA256 hash function) to the input password or passphrase
along with a salt value (32 bytes salt value, generated with os.urandom for each derived key)
and repeats the process many times (100.000 iterations) to produce a derived key,
which can then be used as a cryptographic key in subsequent operations.
The added computational work makes password cracking much more difficult, and is known as
key stretching.
