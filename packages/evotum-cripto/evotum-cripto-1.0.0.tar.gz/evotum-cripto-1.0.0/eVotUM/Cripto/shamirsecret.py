"""
Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic algorithm created by Adi Shamir.
It's a form of secret sharing, where a secret is divided into n parts, giving each
participant its own unique part, where some of the parts or all of them are needed
in order to reconstruct the secret.

Counting on all participants to combine the secret might be impractical, and
therefore sometimes the threshold scheme is used where any k (quorum) of the n parts are
sufficient to reconstruct the original secret.
