        cmddocs
        =======
        
        ``cmddocs`` is an interactive commandline wiki. It
        lets you easily maintain your docs/cheetsheets/notes using:
        
        - Plain Text Files
        - Write ``markdown`` in your local Editor
        - View in your local Pager
        - Versioning with ``git``
        
        cmddocs is like a framework around your plaintext files.
        
        Why ?
        -----
        
        I kind of started ``cmddocs`` because I couldn't find something like
        this on the internet. Here's my usecase. Im working as a DevOps guy
        being in touch with various types of software, languages, tools,
        operating systems and databases. To remember all those things I need a
        place to store commands, workflows and short howtos.
        
        Most of the software I use (and love) runs on a OpenBSD Box on the
        internet and are commandline-based. These are
        `mutt <http://www.mutt.org>`__,
        `taskwarrior <http://taskwarrior.org>`__,
        `jrnl <http://maebert.github.io/jrnl/>`__,
        `weechat <http://weechat.org>`__ and so on...But i was missing a tool
        for documentation.
        
        After switching to just plaintext files using
        ``vim`` and ``git`` it was also a bit annoying. So I wrote
        ``cmddocs`` to make it easier for me to handle my plaintext files.
        
        Markdown Rendering
        ------------------
        
        ``cmddocs`` uses the `mistune <https://github.com/lepture/mistune>`__ lexer to
        wrap markdown with ansi control sequences instead of html tags.
        
        It looks something like this.

        Demo
        ----
        
        To give you an idea what it looks/feels like I created a short terminal
        recording.
        
        `asciinema cmddocs demo <https://asciinema.org/a/15168>`__
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install cmddocs
        
        Also make sure you have `tree` installed.
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Create ``.cmddocsrc`` file in your $HOME with the following content
        (adjust to your needs):
        
        ::
        
            [General]
            Datadir = /home/noqqe/Docs
            Default_Commit_Message = small changes
            Excludedir = .git/
            Editor = /usr/local/bin/vim
            # EditorFlags = -C
            Pager = /usr/bin/less
            PagerFlags = -fr
            Prompt = cmddocs>
            Promptcolor = 37
            Intro_Message = cmddocs - press ? for help
            Mail = mail@example.org
            Default_Extension = md
        
            [Colors]
            Header12 = 37
            Header345 = 37
            Codeblock = 92
        
        The only required option is "Datadir", everything else will be guessed
        or defaults to a sane default value. Once you start cmddocs.py the CLI
        will be shown. Use ``help`` for commands.
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        At first, create a very minimal config, like
        
        ::
        
            [General]
            Datadir = /home/noqqe/Docs
            Editor = /usr/local/bin/vim
            Pager = /usr/bin/less
        
        Then you can start using cmddocs.
        
        ::
        
            $ cmddocs
            cmddocs - press ? for help
            cmddocs> help
        
            Documented commands (type help <topic>):
            ========================================
            EOF  delete  e     help  list  mail  pwd     search  undo
            cd   diff    edit  info  log   move  revert  stats   version
            d    dirs    exit  l     ls    mv    rm      status  view
        
            cmddocs> help l
        
                Show files in current working dir
        
            cmddocs> help log
        
                Show git logs of your docs.
        
                Usage: log                      # default loglines: 10)
                       log 20                   # show 20 loglines
                       log 20 article           # show log for specific article
                       log databases/mongodb 3  # same
