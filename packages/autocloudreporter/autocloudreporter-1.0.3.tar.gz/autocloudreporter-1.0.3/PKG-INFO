Description: autocloudreporter
        =================
        
        ``autocloudreporter`` is a fedmsg consumer for reporting Autocloud
        results to ResultsDB. It listens out for Autocloud fedmsg messages, and
        submits results using the resultsdb\_conventions module for conveniently
        reporting results in 'conventional' format.
        
        The code was written with Python 3 in mind, but it turns out that
        verification of fedmsg message signatures does not currently work in
        Python 3, so it should be run under Python 2 for now.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python libraries:
        
        -  fedmsg
        -  `fedfind <https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/fedfind>`__
        -  `resultsdb\_api <https://pagure.io/taskotron/resultsdb_api>`__
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the required external Python libraries, then use setuptools to
        install, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
                python setup.py install
        
        Test and production modes
        -------------------------
        
        Two consumers are provided, a 'test' and a 'production' consumer. For
        'test':
        
        -  The consumer listens for ``dev`` (not ``prod``) messages
        -  The consumer does not validate message signatures
        -  The consumer reports to a ResultsDB instance running on localhost
           port 5001
        
        In this mode it is safe to play around with the consumer, and you can
        use a tool like ``fedmsg-dg-replay`` to trigger event creation by
        replaying a relevant fedmsg (which will show up with a ``dev`` topic
        rather than ``prod``).
        
        For 'production':
        
        -  The consumer listens for ``prod`` (not ``dev``) messages
        -  The consumer validates message signatures
        -  The consumer reports to the production ResultsDB instance (if
           permitted)
        
        **PLEASE** do not enable the production consumer on a system authorized
        to submit results to ResultsDB without checking with Fedora QA.
        
        The fedmsg config keys for the consumers are
        ``autocloudreporter.test.enabled`` and
        ``autocloudreporter.prod.enabled`` respectively.
