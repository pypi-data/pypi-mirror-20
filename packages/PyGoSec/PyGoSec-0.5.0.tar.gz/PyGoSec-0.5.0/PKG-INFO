        Python wrapper for GO static analyzers
        
        ## Description
        Create a python wrapper for various GO security static analyzers and 
        obtain the results in one place.
        
        Following static analyzers are run:
        1. [**safesql**](https://github.com/stripe/safesql)
        2. [**GOASTScanner**](https://github.com/GoASTScanner/gas)
        
        ### Prerequisites
        1. [GO must be installed](https://golang.org/doc/install)
        2. [GOPATH Environment variable must be defined](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) 
        3. MAC and Linux machines only
        
        ### Usage
        ```
        Usage: python gochecker.py -p <path to code to scan> <options>
                  Options:
                    -h=Display help/usage
