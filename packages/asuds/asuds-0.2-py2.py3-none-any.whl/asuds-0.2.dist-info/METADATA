---------------------------------------
Lightweight SOAP client (Authentise's fork).
---------------------------------------

  Based on the Jurko suds project by Jurko GospodnetiÄ‡ hosted at
https://bitbucket.org/jurko/suds

  Based on the original 'suds' project by Jeff Ortel (jortel at redhat
dot com) hosted at 'http://fedorahosted.org/suds'.

  'Suds' is a lightweight SOAP-based web service client for Python
licensed under LGPL (see the LICENSE.txt file included in the
distribution).

  This is hopefully just a temporary fork of the original suds Python
library project created because the original project development seems
to have stalled. Should be reintegrated back into the original project
if it ever gets revived again.
