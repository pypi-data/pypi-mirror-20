Change log
==========

v0.1.2
------

- Fix local files usage among IPv4/IPv6 processes.

  Before of this release, only *.local* files were included into the route server configuration, for both the IPv4 and IPv6 configurations.
  After this, *.local* files continue to be used for both the address families but *.local4* and *.local6* files can also be used to include IP version specific options, depending on the IP version used to build the configuration. Details `here <https://arouteserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONFIG.html#site-specific-custom-configuration-files>`_.

To upgrade:

.. code:: bash

        # pull from GitHub master branch or use pip:
        pip install --upgrade arouteserver

        # install the new template files into local system
        arouteserver setup
