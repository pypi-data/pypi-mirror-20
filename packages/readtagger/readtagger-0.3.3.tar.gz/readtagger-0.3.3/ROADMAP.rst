Plans and Ideas for continued development of readtagger
-------------------------------------------------------

-----------
v0.3
-----------
* Find clusters of reads from alignment files that are filtered for interesting reads.
  Start with linked clusters that extend across all reads within matepair distance of cluster extremes.
* Find TSDs
* Assemble reads in clusters to find insert sequences
* Output characterized clusters in GFF format

-----------
v0.4
-----------
* Output clustered reads in BAM files
* Quantify readsupport

-----------
v0.5
-----------
* Simulate test-data module

-----------
v0.6
-----------
* Refine clusters if heterogeneous fragments are being assembled
* Blast assembled fragments to better identify insert sequences
