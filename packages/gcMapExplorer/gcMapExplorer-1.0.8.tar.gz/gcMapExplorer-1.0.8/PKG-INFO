Description: Genome Contact Map Explorer - gcMapExplorer
        ===========================================
        
        It is a platform to visualize and analyze the contact maps that are generated from Hi-C experiments. This package is developed by considering the huge size of contact maps at very fine resolution. It contains
        
          * Graphical User Interface - Several windows like applications to perform tasks.
          * Command Line Interface - Several commands to perform tasks.
          * Application Programming Interface - It can be used to perform analysis by any mathematical operations through programming.

        Features:
        ---------
        
        * Support for **huge contact maps** - Use of Disk instead of RAM - Matrices/arrays are stored in Disks - mathematical operations by directly reading/writing from/to Disks, **without loading them into RAM**
        * A browser with rich interfaces for **Comparative** and **Interactive** visualization of **two dimensional contact maps** along with **genomic datasets** such as produced by DNase-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq etc.
        * Contact maps can be **zoomed in/out** from finest resolution to whole chromosome level.
        * Rich customizations of **color scale for contact maps** visualization
        * Rich customizations of **X- and Y- axis properties**.
        
        * Normalization of contact maps by
        
          * **Iterative Correction** (IC)
          * **Knight-Ruiz Matrix Balancing** (KR)
          * **Distance-Frequency**
        
        * A **new file format** for contact map  and genomic datasets:
        
          * **Portable**, **platform independent** and can be read through C/C++, JAVA, Python and R programming language.
          * **Very fast to read** - fast browsing of contact maps and genomic datasets
        
        * Another file format for chormosomal contact map - much faster than above format to read/write but not compact
        * Easy import of Coordinate Sparse, HOMER Interaction matrix and Bin-Contact formats to the new formats.
          * Interface for file format conversions
        * Interface for Normalization
        * Publication ready images at one click.
