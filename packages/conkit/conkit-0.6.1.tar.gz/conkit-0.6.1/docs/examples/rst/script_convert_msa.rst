File Format Conversion
----------------------

If you would like to convert a file from one format to another, you can do so using ConKit's provided script, which is called ``conkit-convert``.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> conkit-convert toxd/toxd.a3m a3m toxd/toxd.fasta fasta

The call above converts the ``toxd.a3m`` file, which is in ``a3m`` format, to the ``toxd.fasta`` file in ``fasta`` format.

You can convert these files to many different other formats, for a full list check out the :ref:`file_formats`.
