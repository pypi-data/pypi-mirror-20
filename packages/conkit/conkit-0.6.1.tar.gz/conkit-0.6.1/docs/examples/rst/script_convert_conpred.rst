File Format Conversion
----------------------

If you would like to convert a file from one format to another, you can do so using ConKit's provided script, which is called ``conkit-convert``.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> conkit-convert toxd/toxd.mat ccmpred toxd/toxd.rr casprr

The call above converts the ``toxd.mat`` file, which is in ``ccmpred`` format, to the ``toxd.rr`` file in ``casprr`` format.

You can convert these files to many different other formats, for a full list check out the :ref:`file_formats`.
