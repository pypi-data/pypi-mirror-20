Trio is an experimental attempt to produce a production-quality,
`permissively licensed
<https://github.com/python-trio/trio/blob/master/LICENSE>`__,
async/await-native I/O library for Python, with an emphasis on
**usability** and **correctness** â€“ we want to make it *easy* to
get things *right*.
