# The close API is a big question here.
#
# Technically, socket close can block if you set various weird
# lingering-related options. This doesn't seem very useful though.
#
# For other kinds of channels, though, the natural implementation definitely
# can block â€“ e.g. TLS wants to send a goodbye message, and if we're tunneling
# over ssh or HTTP/2 e.g. then again closing requires sending some actual
# data. So we need a concept of a blocking close.
#
# BUT, if the other side is uncooperative, we can't necessarily block in
# close. So if a blocking close is cancelled, we need to do some sort of
# forceful cleanup before raising the exception.
#
# (Probably implementing H2-based streams will be a useful forcing function
# here to figure this out.)
