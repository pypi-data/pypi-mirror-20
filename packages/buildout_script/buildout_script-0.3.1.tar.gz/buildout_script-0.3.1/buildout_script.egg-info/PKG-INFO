        Overview
        ********
        
        buildout_script is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe for generating scripts from
        a template.  Unlike scripts specified by the ``console_scripts``
        entry point, those generated by buildout_script are not restricted to
        Python code.
        
        Scripts are generated from templates and can include settings from the
        buildout substituted at runtime.
        
        One example usage is the generation of a wrapper script for `Paste
        Script`_ to check the status of a
        daemonized server process (see paster-check below).
        
        Usage
        *****
        
        To use the buildout_script recipe, specify it as the recipe for a
        zc.buildout part along with the ``template`` part.  For example::
        
          [sample_part]
          recipe = buildout_script
          template = paster-check.sh.in
        
        The script will be created in the bin-directory.  You may also specify
        the following parameters:
        
        target
            The filename for the generated script; if omitted, the script will have
            the template filename without the extension.
        
        template_dir
            An optional directory to look for templates in.  Default: ``templates``
            Templates included with the recipe may also be used without specifying
            a template_dir.
        
        Templates
        *********
        
        Template variables should be formatted using the buildout convention
        of ``${part-name:variable-name}``.
        
        NB. Until version 0.2a1 of buildout_script the python `string formatting syntax`_ was used
        where the dictionary for the formatting operation was a flattened dictionary of the
        buildout settings and part settings.
        
        For example, a trivial script template to list the files in the buildout
        installation directory would look like this::
        
          #!/bin/bash
        
          # Sample buildout_script script template
          ls ${buildout:directory}
        
        buildout_script ships with one script template, ``paster-check.sh.in``,
        described below.  Additional template contributions are welcome.
        
        paster-check.sh.in
        ==================
        
        At Creative Commons we used `Paste Script`_ as the server for simple
        web applications.  We run them using the ``--daemon`` flag, but
        occassionally something goes awry and the process dies.  This template
        generates a script which can be called periodically from cron to
        ensure the process is still running.  Note that this script can also
        be used to start the server if it is not already running.
        
        Configuration Parameters
        ------------------------
        
        Configuration parameters used by this script, which should be specified
        as settings in the zc.buildout part:
        
        server_cfg
          The `Paste Deploy <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy>`_ configuration
          file to serve.
        
        pid_file
          The PID file to use when starting the server (and to subsequently check).
        
        log_file
          The log file to use.
