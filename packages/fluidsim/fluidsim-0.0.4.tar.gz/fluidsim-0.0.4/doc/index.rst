FluidSim documentation
======================

FluidSim is a framework for studying fluid dynamics with numerical
simulations using Python. It is part of the wider project `FluidDyn
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluiddyn/>`_.

The package is still in a planning stage so it is still pretty
unstable and many of its planned features have not yet been
implemented.

FluidSim provides object-oriented libraries to develop quite simple
solvers (mainly using pseudo-spectral methods) by writing mainly
Python code. The result should be quite efficient compared to a pure
Fortran or C++ code since most of the time-consuming tasks are
performed by quite optimized compiled functions (to be better
quantified).

An advantage is that to run simulations and analyze the results, the
users communicate (possibly interactively) with the machine through
Python, which is nowadays among the best languages to do these tasks.
Moreover, it should be much simpler than with pure Fortran or C++
codes to add any complicate analysis. For example, it should be very
simple and quick to write a solver for adjoin equations.

At this stage, just few solvers have been written, but at least
FluidSim can solve these equations:

- Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional periodic space,

- One-layer shallow-water equations in a two-dimensional periodic space,
