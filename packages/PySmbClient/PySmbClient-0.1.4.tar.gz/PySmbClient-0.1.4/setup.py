"""Python smbclient wrapper.

This is a wrapper that works by running the "smbclient" subprocess and providing
an API similar to the one provided by python `os` module.

It is an ugly hack, but it is here for anyone that finds it useful.

The programmer before me was using a "bash" file with lots of smbclient calls, 
so I think my solution is at least better.

Usage example:

>>> smb = smbclient.SambaClient(server="MYSERVER", share="MYSHARE", 
                                username='foo', password='bar', domain='baz')
>>> print smb.listdir("/")
[u'file1.txt', u'file2.txt']
>>> f = smb.open('/file1.txt')
>>> data = f.read()
>>> f.close()
>>> smb.rename(u'/file1.txt', u'/file1.old')
"""
