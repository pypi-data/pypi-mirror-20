Linked list package
-------------------

This package currently supports linked lists and doubly linked lists. Push and pop operations are supported where appropriate.

Sample usage:

    >>> import linked_list as ll
    >>> lst = LL(data=1)
    >>> pushback(lst, LL(data=2))
    >>> print popfront(lst)[1] # Will print 1
