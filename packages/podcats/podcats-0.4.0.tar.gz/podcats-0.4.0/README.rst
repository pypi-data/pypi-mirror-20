Podcats
#######

Podcats generates RSS feeds for podcast episodes from local audio files and,
optionally, exposes both the feed and episodes via a built in web server,
so that they can be conveniently imported into iTunes, Overcast or another
podcast client.

    $ pip install podcats

Generate & serve the feed as well as the files at http://localhost:5000. ::
