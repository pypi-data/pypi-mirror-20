Interactive HTML Widgets
========================

Interactive HTML widgets for JupyterLab notebooks. Since JupyterLab is in its
pre-release stage, this package integrating widgets into JupyterLab should also
be considered experimental.

Usage
=====

Install the corresponding package for your kernel (i.e. Python users would also
install `ipywidgets`).  Refer to that package's documentation for usage
instructions.
