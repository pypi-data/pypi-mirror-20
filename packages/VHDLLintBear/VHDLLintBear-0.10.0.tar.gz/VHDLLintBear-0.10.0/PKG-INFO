Description: 
            Check VHDL code for common codestyle problems.
        
            Rules include:
        
             * Signals, variables, ports, types, subtypes, etc. must be lowercase.
             * Constants and generics must be uppercase.
             * Entities, architectures and packages must be "mixedcase" (may be 100%
               uppercase, but not 100% lowercase).
             * Ports must be suffixed using _i, _o or _io denoting its kind.
             * Labels must be placed in a separated line. Exception: component
               instantiation.
             * End statements must be documented indicating what are finishing.
             * Buffer ports are forbidden.
             * VHDL constructions of the "entity xxxx is" and similars must be in one
               line. You can't put "entity xxxxx" in one line and "is" in another.
             * No more than one VHDL construction is allowed in one line of code.
