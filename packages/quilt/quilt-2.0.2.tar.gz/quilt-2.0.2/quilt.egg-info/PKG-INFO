Description: 
            [Quilt](https://beta.quiltdata.com/) is a data package manager.
            You can use data packages from the community, or publish packages for others to use.
        
            `quilt` is the command-line client that builds, retrieves, and stores
            packages. `quilt` works in conjunction with a server-side registry,
            not covered in this document. `quilt` currently pushes to and pulls from
            the registry at [beta.quiltdata.com](https://beta.quiltdata.com/). In the near
            future users will be able to browse packages in the registry.
