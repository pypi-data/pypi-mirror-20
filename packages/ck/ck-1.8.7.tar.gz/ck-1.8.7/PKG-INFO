        Introduction
        ============
        
        Collective Knowledge is our "swiss knife" for open, collaborative and reproducible experimentation.
        CK is a small, portable and customizable research platform to
        * share artifacts as reusable and indexable Python components with unified JSON API and meta information (programs, benchmarks, data sets, tools, predictive models, etc); 
        * quickly prototype experimental workflows from shared components (such as customizable and multi-objective autotuning for DSL, OpenCL, CUDA, MPI, OpenMP and compiler flags) across diverse hardware and software;
        * crowdsource experiments across diverse hardware and workloads provided by volunteers, and report "interesting" or unexpected behavior;
        * unify and abstract access to continuously evolving software across Windows, Linux and Android (tools, programs, libraries);
        * protect experimental setups from continuous software and hardware changes;
        * use the latest environment for experimental workflows (when Docker or VirtualBox are not suitable);
        * automate, reproduce and crowdsource empirical experiments (using CK JSON-based web services);
        * unify access to predictive analytics via unified JSON API and CK web services (scikit-learn, R, DNN, etc);
        * enable reproducible and interactive articles.

        =======
        * Permissive 3-clause BSD license. (See `LICENSE.txt` for more details).
        
        Minimal installation
        ====================
        
        The minimal installation requires:
        
        * Python 2.7 or 3.3+ (limitation is mainly due to unitests)
        * Python PIP (if you would like to install CK via PIP)
        * Git command line client.
        
        On Ubuntu, you can install these dependencies via
        
        ```
        $ apt-get install -y python python-pip git
        ```
        
        On Windows, you can download and install these tools from the following sites:
        
        * Git: https://git-for-windows.github.io
        * Minimal Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows
        * Anaconda scientific Python with all packages: https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_windows
        
        You can now install stable CK version via PIP simply as following
        (you may need to prefix it with "sudo" on Linux):
        
        ```
        $ pip install ck
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can install development CK version in your local user space
        via GIT as following:
        
        ```
         $ git clone https://github.com/ctuning/ck.git ck
        ```
        and then add CK to PATH on Linux as following:
        ```
         $ export PATH=$PWD/ck/bin:$PATH
        ```
        or on Windows as following:
        
        ```
         $ set PATH={CURRENT PATH}\ck\bin;%PATH%
        ```
        
        Experiment crowdsourcing example
        ================================
        
        You can now test CK by pulling and executing one of multiple shared research scenarios.
        
        ```
         $ ck pull repo:ck-crowdtuning
         $ ck crowdsource experiment
        ```
        
        For example, you can execute shared workflow for collaborative program optimization
        with all related artifacts, and start participating in multi-objective crowdtuning 
        simply as following: 
        
        ```
         $ ck crowdtune program
        ```
        
        You can also crowd-tune GCC on Windows as following:
        ```
         $ ck crowdtune program --gcc --target_os=mingw-64
        ```
        
        If you have GCC or LLVM compilers installed, you can start continuously crowd-tune 
        their optimization heuristics in a quiet mode (for example overnight) via
        
        ```
        $ ck crowdtune program --llvm --quiet
        $ ck crowdtune program --gcc --quiet
        ```
        
        This experimental workflow will be optimizing different shared workloads
        for multiple objectives (execution time, code size, energy, compilation time, etc)
        using all exposed design and optimization knobs, while sending best performing 
        optimizations to the public CK-based server:
        
        * http://cTuning.org/crowd-results
        * http://cknowledge.org/interactive-report
        
        CK server will, in turn, perform on-line learning to classify optimization 
        versus workloads which can be useful for compiler/hardware designers and 
        performance engineers (described in more detail in http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06256 ).
        
        You can even participate in collaborative experiments using your Android mobile phone
        by installing the following application from the Google Play Store:
        
        * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=openscience.crowdsource.experiments
        
        If you want to try something more complex, you can check our cross-platform DNN unification,
        customized installation and benchmarking via CK with JSON API and web services:
        * http://cKnowledge.org/ai
        
        You can find already shared artifacts and repositories here:
        * List of shared repositories: https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-repos
        * List of shared modules: https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-modules
        
        Please check out CK getting started guides and CK wiki for further details:

        * https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows
        * https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki
        
        You can also reuse and customize artifacts with CK-based experimental workflows 
        shared at the leading computer systems' conferences:
        * http://cTuning.org/ae/artifacts.html
        
        Trying CK using Docker image
        ============================
        
        If you would like to try CK without installing it, 
        you can run the following Docker image:
        
        ```
         $ docker run -it ctuning/ck
        ```
        
        However, the idea of CK is to be able to rebuild user experimental workflows
        natively to take advantage of the latest software environment.
        
        Also note that we added Docker automation to CK (to help 
        evaluate artifacts at the conferences, share interactive 
        and reproducible articles or crowdsource experiments for example). 
        
        Please check 'ck-docker' repository at GitHub:
        
        ```
         $ ck show repo:ck-docker
        ```
        
        You can download and view one of our CK-based interactive and reproducible articles as following:
        ```
         $ ck pull repo:ck-docker
         $ ck run docker:ck-interactive-article --browser (--sudo)
        ```
