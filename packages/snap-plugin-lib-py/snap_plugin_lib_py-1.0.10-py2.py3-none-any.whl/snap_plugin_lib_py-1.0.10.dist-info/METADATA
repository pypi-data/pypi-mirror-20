Snap Plugin Library for Python
==============================

This is a library for writing plugins in Python for the `Snap telemetry
framework <https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap>`_ to get started
authoring a plugin checkout: #
`https://intelsdi-x.github.io/snap-plugin-lib-py/ <https://intelsdi-x.github.io/snap-plugin-lib-py/>`_

Brief Overview of Snap Architecture
-----------------------------------

For an overiew of Snap checkout:
`http://snap-telemetry.io/ <http://snap-telemetry.io/>`_

Snap is an open and modular telemetry framework designed to simplify the
collection, processing and publishing of data through a single HTTP
based API. Plugins provide the functionality of collection, processing
and publishing and can be loaded/unloaded, upgraded and swapped without
requiring a restart of the Snap daemon.

A Snap plugin is a program that responds to a set of well defined
`gRPC <http://www.grpc.io/>`_ services with parameters and return types
specified as protocol buffer messages (see
`plugin.proto <https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/control/plugin/rpc/plugin.proto>`_).
The Snap daemon handshakes with the plugin over stdout and then
communicates over gRPC.

Before writing a Snap plugin:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  See if one already exists in the `Plugin
   Catalog <https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/PLUGIN_CATALOG.md>`_
-  See if someone mentioned it in the `plugin
   wishlist <https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/labels/plugin-wishlist>`_

If you do decide to write a plugin, open a new issue following the
plugin `wishlist
guidelines <https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/PLUGIN_CATALOG.md#wish-list>`_
and let us know you are working on one!
