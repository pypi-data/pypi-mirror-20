202: OGEV Itinerary Choice
================================

.. testsetup:: *

   import larch



This example is an OGEV itinerary choice model built using the example
itinerary choice dataset included with Larch.
As usual, we first create the DB objects:

.. testcode::

	d = larch.DB.Example('ITINERARY')

Our itinerary choice data has a lot of alternatives, but they are not
ordered or numbered in a regular way; each elemental alternative has
an arbitrary code number assigned to it, and the code numbers for one case
are not comparable to another case. But we can renumber the alternatives in
a manner that is more suited for our application, such that based on the code
number we can programatically extract a few relevant features of the alternative
that we will want to use in building our OGEV model.  Suppose for example
that we want to test a model which has a departure time of day OGEV structure.  To assign
each alternative into this structure, obviously we'll need to be able to easily
identify the departure time (here we will group by hours) for each alternative.  To renumber,
first we will define the relevant categories and values, and establish a numbering
system using a special object:

.. testcode::

	from enum import Enum

	class departure_hours(Enum):
		h0 = 0
		h1 = 1
		h2 = 2
		h3 = 3
		h4 = 4
		h5 = 5
		h6 = 6
		h7 = 7
		h8 = 8
		h9 = 9
		h10 = 10
		h11 = 11
		h12 = 12
		h13 = 13
		h14 = 14
		h15 = 15
		h16 = 16
		h17 = 17
		h18 = 18
		h19 = 19
		h20 = 20
		h21 = 21
		h22 = 22
		h23 = 23

	from larch.util.numbering import numbering_system
	ns = numbering_system(departure_hours)

Then we can use a special command on the DB object to assign new alternative
numbers.

.. testcode::

	d.recode_alts(ns, 'data_ca', 'casenum', 'ogevitinerarycode',
		'depart_time/60',
		newaltstable='ogevitinerarycodes',
	)

As arguments to this command, we provide the numbering system object, the
name of the table that contains the idca data to be numbered (here data_ca),
the name of the column in that table that names the caseids, and the name of
a new column to be created (or overwritten) with the new code numbers.  We also
need to give a set of SQL expressions that can be evaluated on the rows of the
table to get the categorical values that we defined in the Enums above. Lastly,
we can pass the name of a new table that will be created to identify every
observed alternative code.

Now let's make our model.  We'll use a few variables to define our
linear-in-parameters utility function.

.. testcode::

	m = larch.Model(d)

	vars = [
		"carrier=2",              
		"carrier=3",              
		"carrier=4",              
		"carrier>=5",
		"aver_fare_hy",
		"aver_fare_ly",           
		"itin_num_cnxs",
		"itin_num_directs",       
	]
	for var in vars:
		m.utility.ca(var)

Now it's time to build the network that will define our nesting structure.
First we'll need to have the list of all the alternative codes we created
above.

.. testcode::

	alts = d.alternative_codes()

Then we can build the network by looping over various categories to define
the nodes.


.. testcode::

	for hour in departure_hours:
		prev_hour = departure_hours((hour.value-1)%24)
		next_hour = departure_hours((hour.value+1)%24)
		time_nest = m.new_nest(hour.name, param_name="mu_ogev", parent=m.root_id)
		for a in alts:
			if ns.code_matches_attributes(a, hour):
				m.link(time_nest, a)
			if ns.code_matches_attributes(a, next_hour):
				m.link(time_nest, a)
				m.link[time_nest, a](data='1',param='PHI_next')
			if ns.code_matches_attributes(a, prev_hour):
				m.link(time_nest, a)
				m.link[time_nest, a](data='1',param='PHI_prev')

In this block, the outermost loop is over departure hour.  Within that, we define the
previous and next hours (this is easily expandible to include multiple hours in each OGEV nest)
and a nest to group together the three hours.  Then we loop over alternatives and link each one
if it matches the target hour, or the next or previous hour.  We also add a PHI parameter to the
next and previous hour alternatives, to control the allocation of the alternatives to the OGEV
level nests.  The target hour link has no PHI parameter because it is the reference point.

The PHI parameters replace the ALPHA allocation parameters commonly seen in OGEV models in the
literature, and are used to recreate the allocation parameters according to:

.. math::

	\alpha_i = \frac{ \exp(\phi_i \cdot Z_i) }{ \sum_j \exp(\phi_j \cdot Z_j) }

where Z is potentially some :ref:`idco` data, although in the example shown here it is simply
a constant (1).

For this example, since we want it to run quickly, we'll limit the input
data to only a few cases, and turn off the the automatic calculation of standard errors.
We'll also tell the optimization engine to enforce logsum parameter ordering constraints.

.. testcode::

	filter = 'casenum < 20000'
	d.queries.idca_build(filter=filter)
	d.queries.idco_build(filter=filter)
	m.option.calc_std_errors = False
	m.option.enforce_network_constraints = False
	m.option.enforce_bounds = False

Now it's time to run it and see what we get.  We'll use the SLSQP algorithm because it can
use the automatic parameter constraints (most of the available algorithms cannot):

.. doctest::
	:options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

	>>> result = m.maximize_loglike('SLSQP', metaoptions={'ftol': 1e-08})
	>>> result.message
	'Optimization terminated successfully...

	>>> print(m)

Don't worry that these results don't look great; we used a very tiny dataset here with a
complex model.  This example was just to walk you through the mechanics of specifying and
estimating this model, not showing you how to get a good model with the data, which is an
exercise left for the reader.

.. tip::

	If you want access to the model in this example without worrying about assembling all the code blocks
	together on your own, you can load a read-to-estimate copy like this::

		m = larch.Model.Example(202)
