Description: TheHive4py
        ==========
        
        TheHive4py is a Python API client for
        `TheHive <https://thehive-project.org/>`__, a scalable 3-in-1 open
        source and free security incident response platform designed to make
        life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security
        practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be
        investigated and acted upon swiftly.
        
        TheHive4py allows analysts to create cases out of different sources such
        as email. For example, the SOC may ask its constituency to send
        suspicious email reports to a specific mailbox that a script may poll at
        regular intervals. When a new email is received, the script will parse
        it then call TheHive4py to create the case in TheHive. Analysts will be
        informed that a new case has been created through TheHive's Flow and
        start their investigation right away.
        
        Caution - WIP
        =============
        
        TheHive4py is a work-in-progress. TheHive authors use it on a regular
        basis and features will be added as the need arise.
        
        Please note that a new version of TheHive will be released by the end of
        April / beginning of May 2017 and it will feature a Scala connector
        framework to handle alerts, which translate to cases if analysts deem
        them worth investigating, in a more generic and resilient fashion. The
        connector framework will allow SOCs and CERTs to interface TheHive with
        SIEMs, email and other services.
        
        When the connector framework is published, TheHive authors may not
        maintain TheHive4py on the long run but since it is a FOSS, the
        community can fork it and enhance it the way they see fit. Pull requests
        will be reviewed by TheHive core team and accepted if they are OK.
