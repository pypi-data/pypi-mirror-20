def spiral_sample_image(h, w, scan_length, num_points, rect_area=False):
    """
    Sample an image using an archimedean spiral pattern.

    The coordinates (in units of pixels) resulting from sampling an image of
    size `h` times `w` using an archimedean spiral pattern are determined. The
    `scan_length` determines the length of the path scanned whereas
    `num_points` indicates the number of samples taken on that path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h : int
        The height of the area to scan in units of pixels.
    w : int
        The width of the area to scan in units of pixels.
    scan_length : float
        The length of the path to scan in units of pixels.
    num_points : int
        The number of samples to take on the scanned path.
    rect_area : bool
        A flag indicating whether or not the full rectangular area is sampled
        (the default value is False which implies that the "corners" of the
        rectangular area are not sampled).

    Returns
    -------
    coords : ndarray
        The coordinates of the samples arranged into a 2D array, such that each
        row is a coordinate pair (x, y).

    Notes
    -----
    The orientation of the coordinate system is such that the width `w` is
    measured along the x-axis whereas the height `h` is measured along the
    y-axis. The width must equal the height for an archimedian spiral to make
    sense.

    If the `rect_area` flag is True, then it is assumed that the sampling
    continues outside of the rectangular area specified by `h` and `w` such
    that the "corners" of the rectangular area are also sampled. The sample
    points outside of the rectangular area are discarded and, hence, not
    returned.
