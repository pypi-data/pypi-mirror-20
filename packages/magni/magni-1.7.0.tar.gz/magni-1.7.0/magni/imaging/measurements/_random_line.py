    """
    Sample an image using a set of random straight lines.

    The coordinates (in units of pixels) resulting from sampling an image of
    size `h` times `w` using a pattern based on a set of random straight lines
    are determined. The `scan_length` determines the length of the path scanned
    whereas `num_points` indicates the number of samples taken on that path. If
    `discrete` is set, it specifies the finite number of equally spaced lines
    from which the scan lines are be chosen at random. For reproducible
    results, the `seed` may be used to specify a fixed seed of the random
    number generator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h : int
        The height of the area to scan in units of pixels.
    w : int
        The width of the area to scan in units of pixels.
    scan_length : float
        The length of the path to scan in units of pixels.
    num_points : int
        The number of samples to take on the scanned path.
    discrete : int or None, optional
        The number of equally spaced lines from which the scan lines are chosen
        (the default is None, which implies that no discritisation is used).
    seed : int or None, optional
        The seed used for the random number generator (the defaul is None,
        which implies that the random number generator is not seeded).

    Returns
    -------
    coords : ndarray
        The coordinates of the samples arranged into a 2D array, such that each
        row is a coordinate pair (x, y).

    Notes
    -----
    The orientation of the coordinate system is such that the width `w` is
    measured along the x-axis whereas the height `h` is measured along the
    y-axis.

    Each of the scanned lines span the entire width of the image with the
    exception of the last line that may only be partially scanned if the
    `scan_length` implies this. The top and bottom lines of the image are
    always included in the scan.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from magni.imaging.measurements import random_line_sample_image
    >>> h = 10
    >>> w = 10
    >>> scan_length = 50.0
