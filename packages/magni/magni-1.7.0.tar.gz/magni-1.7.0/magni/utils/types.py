class ClassProperty(property):
    """
    Class property.

    The present class is a combination of the built-in property type and the
    built-in classmethod type. That is, it is a property which is invoked on a
    class rather than an instance but is available to both the class and its
    instances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fget : function, optional
        The getter function of the property. (the default is None, which
        implies that the property cannot be read)
    fset : function, optional
        The setter function of the property. (the default is None, which
        implies that the property cannot be written)
    fdel : function, optional
        The deleter function of the property. (the default is None, which
        implies that the property cannot be deleted)
    doc : string, optional
        The docstring of the property. (the default is None, which implies that
        the docstring of the getter function, if any, is used)

    See Also
    --------
    property : Superclass from which all behaviour is inherited or extended.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example illustrates the difference between regular properties
    and class properties. First, the example class is defined and instantiated:

    >>> from magni.utils.types import ClassProperty
    >>> class Example(object):
    ...     _x_class = 0
    ...     def __init__(self, x):
    ...         self._x_instance = x
    ...     @ClassProperty
    ...     def x_class(class_):
    ...         return class_._x_class
    ...     @property
    ...     def x_instance(self):
    ...         return self._x_instance
    >>> example = Example(1)

    The regular read-only property works on the instance:

    >>> print('{!r}'.format(example.x_instance))
    1
    >>> print('Is property? {!r}'.format(isinstance(Example.x_instance,
    ...                                             property)))
    Is property? True

    The class property, on the other hand, works on the class:

    >>> print('{!r}'.format(example.x_class))
    0
    >>> print('Is property? {!r}'.format(isinstance(Example.x_class,
    ...                                             property)))
    Is property? False
    >>> print('{!r}'.format(Example.x_class))
    0

    """

    def __init__(self, fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None):

    def __get__(self, obj, class_=None):
        """
        The get method of the property.

        Parameters
        ----------
        obj : object
            The instance on which the property is requested.
        class_ : type, optional
            The class on which the property is requested. (the default is None,
            which implies that the class is retrieved from `obj`)

        Returns
        -------
        value : None
            The value of the property.

    Examples
    --------
    This ordered dict subclass exposes the same interface as the OrderedDict
    class when not using methods that alter the dict.
