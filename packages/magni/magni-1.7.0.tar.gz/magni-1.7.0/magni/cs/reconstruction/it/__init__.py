Subpackage providing implementations of Iterative Thresholding (IT).

Routine listings
----------------
config
    Configger providing configuration options for this subpackage.
run(y, A)
    Run the IT reconstruction algorithm.

Notes
-----
Implementations of Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) [1]_, [2]_ as well as
implementations of Iterative Soft Thresholding (IST) [3]_, [4]_ are available.
It is also possible to configure the subpackage to use a model based approach
as described in [5]_.
