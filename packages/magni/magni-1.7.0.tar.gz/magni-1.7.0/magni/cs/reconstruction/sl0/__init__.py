Subpackage providing implementations of Smoothed l0 Norm (SL0).

The implementations provided are the original SL0 reconstruction algorithm and
a modified SL0 reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm used depends on the
'algorithm' configuration option: 'std' refers to the original algorithm while
'mod' (default) refers to the modified algorithm.

Routine listings
----------------
config
    Configger providing configuration options for this subpackage.
run(y, A)
    Run the specified SL0 reconstruction algorithm.

Notes
-----
See `_algorithm` for documentation of `run`.

Implementations of the original SL0 reconstruction algorithm [1]_ and a
modified Sl0 reconstruction algorithm [3]_ are available. It is also possible
to configure the subpackage to provide customised versions of the SL0
reconstruction algorithm. The projection algorithm [1]_ is used for small delta
(< 0.55) whereas the contraint elimination algorithm [2]_ is used for large
delta (>= 0.55) which merely affects the computation time.
