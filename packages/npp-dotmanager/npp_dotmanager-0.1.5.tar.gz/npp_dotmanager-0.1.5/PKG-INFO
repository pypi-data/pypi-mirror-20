Description: # n++ dotfiles
        npp_dotfiles makes it easy to use and manage your configuration files
            while keeping them in one secure directory (like Dropbox or other hosts). You can
            configure it to symlink your files to their destination directory with support to different
            names in backup and working dirs. More, you can manage the config files, that you want to
            share with others separate from your private ones. Uses git to automatically push and pull
            repositories on backup.
        A dotfiles syncer and symlinker, written in python, with Git syncing support.
        
        __Current stable version is 0.1.__
