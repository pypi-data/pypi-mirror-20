        HURUmap is a Django application for exploring census and other similar data. It makes it easy to understand a place
        through the eyes of the data, and to explore data across a range of places. It is most suited for census data
        but can easily be used with other data that is similarly focused on places in a country.
        
        Check out `HURUmap Tanzania <http://tanzania.hurumap.org>`_ and `HURUmap Kenya <http://kenya.hurumap.org>`_ to
        get an idea of what HURUmap is about.
        
        HURUmap is a fork of `Wazimap <https://github.com/Code4SA/wazimap>`_ and the excellent `Censusreporter <https://censusreporter.org>`_ project which was funded by a
        `Knight News Challenge grant <http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/10/knight-funding-expands-ires-journalist-friendly-census-site/>`_.
        You can also find `Censusreporter on GitHub <https://github.com/censusreporter/censusreporter>`_.
