        * Zooming (1:N and N:1)
        * Mouse control of window center and width (as in Aeskulap Viewer)
        * Proper measurement of Hounsfield units and position by mouse
        * PNG image export
        
        To Do
        -----
        
        * Better zooming
        * Better MRI images support
        * RT dose images support
        * View in different planes (rectangular + others)
        * Coordinate mapping (using translation and rotation matrix)
        * Integration of anonymization features (see https://github.com/janpipek/anonymize_dicom )
        * Information from the DICOM file in user-friendly display
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        * Python 3 / Python 2.7 (not tested)
        * qtpy (and therefore PyQt4 / PyQt5 / PySide)
        * pydicom (0.9.9, maybe also 1.0)
        
        Tested on Linux and Windows.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        The easiest way is `pip install pydiq`.
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        Currently, the viewer supports only Computed Radiography (CR), Computed Tomography (CT) and
        Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images with normal orientation (x, y, z)
        in one-slice-per-file format.
