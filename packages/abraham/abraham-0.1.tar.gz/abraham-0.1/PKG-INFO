        DBC files for Lincoln MKZ and Ford Fusion
        
        This is a crowdsourced repository to decode Ford Fusion's and Lincoln MKZ can bus, we will share data dumps for the different models here and creae issues for each of the id codes.
        
        Issues will have the following format <model acronym><year>x<can id>. For example, for a ford fusion 2017 and id 0x320: `FF2017x320`, we will share links to data dumps that contain that code and use the ticket description to explain it fully. Once it is explained and added to the `.dbc` file we can close the ticket.
